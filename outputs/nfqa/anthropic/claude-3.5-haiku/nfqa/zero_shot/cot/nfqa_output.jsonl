Analyze the specific roles mentioned in the answer choices:\n• (A) Structural integrity - This means providing physical strength and maintaining the membrane's shape\n• (B) Enhance permeability - This relates to allowing molecules to pass through\n• (C) Contribute to selectivity - This means filtering or separating specific molecules\n• (D) Facilitate cleaning - This suggests making the membrane easier to clean\n\n4. Reasoning about the support layer:\n• Its primary function is typically to provide a stable physical base\n• It helps maintain the membrane's shape and prevents mechanical breakdown\n• It supports the more selective or active layers of the membrane\n\n5. Conclusion:\n• The most appropriate answer is (A) To provide structural integrity\n\nThe support layer's main role is to provide structural integrity to the composite membrane, ensuring its physical stability and durability.\n\nThe answer is (A).", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful medical assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: What is the role of the support layer in composite membranes?\nAnswer Choices: (A) To provide structural integrity.

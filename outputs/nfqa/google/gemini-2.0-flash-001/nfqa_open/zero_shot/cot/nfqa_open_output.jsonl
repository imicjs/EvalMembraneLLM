Visual Confirmation via Microscopy (TEM/SEM):**\n\n*   **Context Clue:** \"In Fig. 3(c), zeolite nanoparticles appear considerably darker than the polymer and are clearly located within the cross-section of the thin film, but also at the interface.\"\n*   **Explanation:**  The most direct method is to use microscopy techniques that can visualize the nanoparticles within the membrane structure.\n    *   **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM):** TEM is ideal for high-resolution imaging of the membrane cross-section.  The difference in electron density between the nanoparticles (e.g., zeolites) and the polymer matrix will result in contrast variations in the TEM image.  The nanoparticles should appear as distinct, darker spots or regions within the polymer film.\n    *   **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM):** SEM can also be used, especially if combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SEM provides surface morphology information, and EDS can confirm the elemental composition of the nanoparticles within the membrane.  Look for bright spots or regions on the membrane surface or cross-section that correspond to the elemental composition of the nanoparticles.\n\n**2. Surface Roughness Analysis (AFM):**\n\n*   **Context Clue:** \"Both TFC and TFN membranes exhibit nano-scale surface roughness, which is a well-known characteristic of interfacial polymerized polyamide RO membranes.\"\n*   **Explanation:** Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) can be used to characterize the surface roughness of the membrane. While the base TFC membrane already has some roughness, the incorporation of nanoparticles *may* alter the surface roughness. An increase in surface roughness can be an indicator of successful nanoparticle incorporation, but it's not definitive on its own.

Elemental Analysis (EDS/XPS):**\n\n*   **Explanation:**\n    *   **Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS):** As mentioned earlier, when coupled with SEM, EDS can identify the elemental composition of specific regions within the membrane. If the nanoparticles contain elements not present in the base polymer, EDS can confirm their presence and distribution.\n    *   **X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS):** XPS is a surface-sensitive technique that provides information about the elemental composition and chemical states of the membrane surface.

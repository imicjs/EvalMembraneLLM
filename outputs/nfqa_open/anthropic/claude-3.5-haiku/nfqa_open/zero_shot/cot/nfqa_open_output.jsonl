IP (Interfacial Polymerization) is a technique used to form thin films or membranes at the interface between two immiscible liquids.\n\n2. Self-limiting behavior means the reaction stops spontaneously after forming a certain thickness or reaching a specific point.\n\n3. In some IP reactions, self-limiting behavior is observed:\n- The reaction can stop when monomers at the interface are consumed\n- Formation of a dense polymer layer can block further diffusion and reaction\n- Steric hindrance can prevent continued growth\n\n4. However, IP is not ALWAYS self-limiting:\n- Reaction conditions can influence film growth\n- Concentration of reactants\n- Temperature\n- Solvent properties\n- Reaction time\n\n5. Factors that can prevent self-limiting behavior:\n- Excess reactants\n- Continuous supply of monomers\n- Specific reaction chemistry\n- Specific membrane formation conditions\n\n6. Conclusion: IP is NOT always self-limiting.

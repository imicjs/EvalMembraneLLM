The solute concentration in the feed is given as 3 wt%, which means out of 100 grams of water, there are 3 grams of solute. This translates to a molar fraction of the solute in the feed, considering the molecular weight of water is approximately 18 g/mol and the solute's molecular weight is not provided. However, we can bypass solving for the solute's molecular weight since our goal is the concentration, not the specific molecular weight.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the solute in the permeate.\nGiven that the permeate contains 300mg/L of solute, we don't need to calculate its concentration because it's directly provided.\n\n## Step 3: Use the concept of rejection rate.\nThe rejection rate (R) can be calculated using the formula: Rejection Rate = (Concentration in Feed - Concentration in Permeate) / Concentration in Feed.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the rejection rate.\nSubstituting the given values into the formula: Rejection Rate = (3 mg/L - 300 mg/L) / (3 mg/L).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation.\nRejection Rate = (-297 mg/L) / (3 mg/L) = -99%.\n\nHowever, rejection rate cannot be negative because we're calculating the difference in concentration after treating.

It's known for its ability to bind to various molecules, including proteins and other polysaccharides.\n\n2. **HA and membrane interactions**: When HA is adsorbed onto a membrane surface, it can interact with the membrane material and the solutes (like boron) that pass through it. This interaction can affect the membrane's selectivity and permeability.\n\n3. **Effect on boron rejection**: Boron rejection refers to the membrane's ability to prevent boron ions from passing through it. The presence of HA on the membrane surface can alter the membrane's properties, potentially affecting boron rejection.\n\n4. **Considering the options**:\n   - **Increase (A)**: If HA adsorption increases the membrane's selectivity or reduces its permeability, it could lead to an increase in boron rejection.\n   - **Decrease (B)**: Conversely, if HA adsorption decreases the membrane's selectivity or increases its permeability, it could lead to a decrease in boron rejection.\n   - **Unchange (C)**: If HA adsorption has no effect on the membrane's properties related to boron rejection, then the rejection would remain unchanged.\n   - **Not clearly (D)**: This option suggests that the effect of HA on boron rejection is not straightforward or well-understood.\n\nGiven the potential for HA to alter membrane properties and considering the principles of membrane science, the most likely effect of HA adsorption on boron rejection would be a change, but the direction of the change (increase or decrease) would depend on the specifics of the membrane material, the concentration of HA, and the conditions under which the experiment is conducted.

It's known for its ability to bind to various molecules, including proteins and other polysaccharides.\n\n2. **HA and membrane interactions**: When HA is adsorbed onto a membrane surface, it can interact with the membrane material and the solutes (like boron) that pass through it. This interaction can affect the membrane's selectivity and permeability.\n\n3. **Effect on boron rejection**: Boron rejection refers to the membrane's ability to prevent boron ions from passing through it. The presence of HA on the membrane surface can alter the membrane's properties, potentially affecting boron rejection.\n\n4. **Considering the options**:\n   - **Increase (A)**: If HA adsorption increases the membrane's selectivity or reduces its permeability, it could lead to an increase in boron rejection.\n   - **Decrease (B)**: Conversely, if HA adsorption decreases the membrane's selectivity or increases its permeability, it could lead to a decrease in boron rejection.\n   - **Unchange (C)**: If HA adsorption has no effect on the membrane's properties related to boron rejection, then the rejection would remain unchanged.\n   - **Not clearly (D)**: This option suggests that the effect of HA on boron rejection is not straightforward or well-understood.\n\nGiven the potential for HA to alter membrane properties and considering the principles of membrane science, the most likely effect of HA adsorption on boron rejection would be a change, but the direction of the change (increase or decrease) would depend on the specifics of the membrane material, the concentration of HA, and the conditions under which the experiment is conducted.

However, this huge O/N ratio difference is not observed on PIP/TMC membrane. This can be attributed to the significant molecular size difference between PIP and PEI. In a typical interfacial polymerization process, the small amine monomers (PIP) can easily pass through the nascent polyamide film into the organic phase to continuously react with TMC until a thick and dense polyamide layer is formed.

Figure 1 presents the SEM micrographs of the PCTE substrates (top view) and the polyamide films (both top and bottom views). It is important to note that the actual pore size of PCTE-200 and PCTE-800 was approximately 70−90 nm larger than the respective nominal sizes provided by the manufacturer (Table 1). The nominal sizes of other PCTE substrates were reasonably accurate. The top surfaces of polyamide films show leaf-like roughness features whose presence was most obvious for TFC-80 and TFC-100. Increasing the substrate pore size from 100 to 800 nm led to the diminishing of these characteristic features. According to our recent works, the leaf-like features were formed due to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that are encapsulated between the polyamide film and the substrate. Increasing the pore size of the substrate would reduce the confinement effect by the substrate and allow the nanobubbles to escape through the large pores. In contrast to the common belief that leaves grow directly over pores, we observed smooth and flat polyamide films spanning over the pores of 80−200 nm (highlighted by the dotted circles in Figure 2). Indeed, the leaf-like features developed predominantly around the pores.

This degassing can possibly happen both inside the substrate pores and at the vicinity of the pores. The confinement effect by the solid matrix around the pores allows the CO2 nanobubbles to be retained, which shapes the leaf-like roughness features. However, the confinement effect was the weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, which prevents effective retention of degassed nanobubbles. Therefore, our study further confirms the critical importance of the substrate confinement effect in shaping the polyamide surface roughness. This confinement effect also explains why surface roughness could not effectively develop for polyamide films formed at free interfaces.

The polyamide nanofilm thickness is handily adjusted by the thickness of hydrophilic layers to tune the absorption of diamine solution within substrates (Fig. 2D to G and Fig. S6). The piperazine reserved within the Janus substrate declined from 228.7 to 25.4 nmol/cm2 with the same piperazine concentration of 34.8 mM when the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreased from 40.5 to 15.7 μm. Meanwhile, the nanofilm thickness is dramatically reduced from 88.4 to 3.8 nm as the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreases. It is worth noting the polyamide nanofilm with a thickness of 3.8 nm is one of the thinnest polyamide nanofilms as reported in the literature. This result demonstrates that Janus substrates provide an accessible, alternative, and novel “interfacial reactor” to effectively regulate the polyamide nanofilm thickness. Moreover, the hydrophobic layer can prevent the penetration of the aqueous solution into the substrate, especially for the large-pore substrates. The effect of the total piperazine amount on nanofilm morphology was observed by SEM. No polyamide nanofilm is formed on the nascent PPMM substrate because the diamine solution cannot be spread on the hydrophobic surface (Fig. S7). The porous surface was gradually covered by polyamide nanofilms synthesized by an increased diamine amount.

{"id": "test-00044", "question": "Which monomers were used in the interfacial polymerization? What role did PIP play in the polyamide network formation?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. The MWCO of the polyamide composite ceramic membranes was tested with PEGs and diethylene glycol, and both of the membranes PA100 and PA-200 had a similar MWCO of 240–260 Da, as shown in Fig. 9. The membrane MWCO was smaller than most of the PEI-based polyamide membranes on hollow fibre or tubular membrane substrates [19,29,43]. Pure PEI-based polyamide membranes usually have MWCO between 350 and 500 Da and the addition of PIP in this study has shown effective in reducing the MWCO of the membranes without reducing the flux significantly. The PEG rejection of PA-200 was slightly lower than PA-100, which could be due to minor defects in the polyamide layer. The membrane PA-100 was also tested for sugar and dye rejections. The rejections of raffinose (504 g/mol), sucrose (342 g/mol) and glucose (180 g/mol) were 99.1, 98.9 and 87.4%, respectively, and the rejections of rose bagel (875 g/mol), acid fuschin (586 g/mol) and methyl orange (327 g/mol) were 99.2, 99.9 and 99.0%, respectively.

The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane.

Reason for contact angle increase:\n- PEI molecules contain many hydrophobic vinyl groups\n- As PEI concentration increases, more of these hydrophobic groups are present on the membrane surface\n\n3.

{"id": "test-00071", "question": "What does the following context mainly explain?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nOur results show a clear inverse correlation between the parameters; that is, salt permeability is reduced with the increase in |ζ|, which implies that ZP is a reasonable indicator for Donnan exclusion. For instance, at pH 4.0 and I = 1 mM, the |ζ| is relatively low due to weak membrane charge with the accompanying reduced Donnan effects, which results in relatively high ion permeability (Fig. 4b). At pH 7.5 and high ionic strength, the |ζ| is greater and consequently ion permeability is reduced. The main reason for the lower permeability under these conditions is schematically explained in Fig. 4c, showing higher membrane charge, which is partly neutralized by the ions. At pH 7.5 and low ionic strength (Fig. 4d), there is limited charge screening, therefore many membrane charges generate strong Donnan effects resulting in very low permeability. The ZP results may also imply subtle differences in Donnan exclusion experienced by Li+ and Cs+, as reflected by the good correlation between the ratios of LiCl and CsCl ζ (rζ 1⁄4 ζLiCl=ζCsCl) and Ps (rP 1⁄4 PsðLiClÞ=PsðCsClÞ). Notably, the largest rζ was obtained at pH 7.5 and 1 mM, where the negative membrane charge is high (Fig. 1a, c) and charge screening is minor (Fig. 4d), leading to noticeable differences in Cs+ and Li+ permeabilities (rP = 0.74). It is stressed that we tested the match between ZP and Donnan exclusion only for pH ≤ 7.5, where the fixed membrane charge is solely influenced by protonation of carboxyl groups (Eq. (1)), while the amine groups are positively charged throughout the pH range. Thus, in the tested conditions, ZP is directly related to the overall number of charged fixed groups. On the other hand, at pH > 7.5, the increase in |ζ| with pH is the outcome of the protonation of  charged amine groups (i.e., Eq. (2)), resulting in a decrease in overall number of charged groups, but an increase in the overall negative charge.

{"id": "test-00080", "question": "How does the presence of terminal carboxyl and amino groups affect the performance of polyamide membranes?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nIn contrast, when HABD is used to describe the crosslinked networks of polyamide, we observe a clear correlation between HABD and the performance of reverse osmosis polyamide membranes. Fig. 3C illustrates an overall improvement of NaCl rejection with the increase of HABD. The Spearman correlation coefficient for this relationship is 0.649, much larger than that of DNC. This indicates a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection. Likewise, a discernible trend of decreasing water permeance and NaCl permeability coefficient is visible with the increase of HABD (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10). Thanks to the comprehensive analysis of the polyamide structure, the calculated HABD consistently holds physical significance regardless of the proportion of terminal groups. The increase of terminal groups only decreases the value of HABD but will not cause it to become negative. This ensures that HABD can work for loose polyamides with rich terminal groups. Furthermore, HABD more accurately describes the correlations between crosslinked networks and performance. The closer the value of HABD is to 9.3 mmol g-1, the fewer carboxyl and amino groups are present in polyamide, indicating a higher conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization. Crosslinked polyamide membranes with higher HABD thus exhibit  reduced free volume and pore size resulting in higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance. Our analysis then extends to PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes. In this case, the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance becomes more challenging due to the contribution of both pore size and charge properties of polyamide membranes. A denser network provides a higher blocking ability to salt ions owing to the size exclusion effect, while the presence of abundant charge on the membrane surface can also block high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect. Most PIP-TMC polyamide membranes possess a substantial number of hydrolyzed TMC terminal structures and exhibit negative charges, exacerbating the difficulty to establish the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance.

Fig. 3C illustrates an overall improvement of NaCl rejection with the increase of HABD. The Spearman correlation coefficient for this relationship is 0.649, much larger than that of DNC. This indicates a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection. Likewise, a discernible trend of decreasing water permeance and NaCl permeability coefficient is visible with the increase of HABD (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10). Thanks to the comprehensive analysis of the polyamide structure, the calculated HABD consistently holds physical significance regardless of the proportion of terminal groups. The increase of terminal groups only decreases the value of HABD but will not cause it to become negative. This ensures that HABD can work for loose polyamides with rich terminal groups. Furthermore, HABD more accurately describes the correlations between crosslinked networks and performance. The closer the value of HABD is to 9.3 mmol g-1, the fewer carboxyl and amino groups are present in polyamide, indicating a higher conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization. Crosslinked polyamide membranes with higher HABD thus exhibit  reduced free volume and pore size resulting in higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance. Our analysis then extends to PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes. In this case, the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance becomes more challenging due to the contribution of both pore size and charge properties of polyamide membranes. A denser network provides a higher blocking ability to salt ions owing to the size exclusion effect, while the presence of abundant charge on the membrane surface can also block high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect.

{"id": "test-00081", "question": "What structural parameter is used in HABD calculation to account for carboxyl and amino groups? How does the MgCl2 rejection change as the carboxyl density increase?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs the amide bond density decreases and the number of terminal groups increases in the crosslinked network, PIP-TMC polyamide membrane exhibits higher water permeance. This is expected because a more loosely crosslinked polyamide network with increased terminal groups provides larger voids and facilitates the transport of water molecules. However, the change in Na2SO4 rejection is not significantly affected by the variation in HABD. This observation can be explained by the presence of rich charges on the membrane surface, which blocks high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect as mentioned. To quantify terminal groups and analyze their ionization behavior, we have introduced two analogous parameters, namely the harmonic carboxyl density (HCD) and the harmonic amino density (HAD). These parameters, reflecting the contents of carboxyl and amino groups per mass of polyamide, are essential in accurately representing the surface charge of polyamides (Section 4 in Supplementary Information). It was demonstrated that PIP-TMC polyamide with higher HCD exhibits a stronger negative charge and higher Na2SO4 rejection (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). This finding strongly supports the notion that incorporating strong negative charges is effective in rejecting divalent anions when designing nanofiltration membranes. Nonetheless, the rejection of nanofiltration membranes is contributed by two factors: the screening of pores brought by polyamide networks and the Donnan effect of surface charge. Therefore, it is challenging to establish reliable structure-activity relationships by isolating these two factors.

Firstly, the cross-linking temperature was studied at fixed concentration for gallic acid (0.1 wt%) and PEI (1 wt%) in coating solutions and cross-linking time of 30 min and the corresponding results were given in the Fig. 8. The permeate fluxes were sharply decreased from 50 L/m2·h to 10 L/m2·h (for Gongo red) and from 45 L/m2·h to 9.2 L/m2·h (for Methyl blue) while rejection ratios of Gongo red and Methyl blue increased slightly. This proved that skin layer formed by coating modified PEI became denser with increasing the temperature from 45 °C to 75 °C. Therefore, the cross-linking temperature was an important factor influening on  separation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane.

Especially for PA200, the area with high moduli is very distinct from the area with low moduli. The mean moduli obtained were 5.11 and 3.95 GPa for membrane PA-100 and PA-200, respectively, and these values were higher than the modulus of commercial polyamide nylon [39]. The moduli were also higher than that measured using the wrinkling-cracking method, where one of the highest modulus values measured was only 2.71 GPa [16]. The high moduli measured in this study could be contributed by the ceramic substrates underneath the polyamide layer, and further analysis on the measured data was required to determine the real modulus of the polyamide layer.

How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction.

Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)).

This result was reasonable for positively charged NF membrane and corroborated the benefits of a relatively dense selectivity layer brought about by the co-deposition of PDA/PEI.

How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction. A systematic investigation of these parameters will be a focus in our future studies. Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)). As already been attested by previously study, such an observation suggested that the Donnan exclusion theory played a major role [17]. On the other hand, the salt rejection test suggested that the LBL-cPP NF membrane reached the 90% rejection for divalent  cations and about 20% rejection for monovalent cations, while maintaining the order of MgCl2 > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 > NaCl. This result was reasonable for positively charged NF membrane and corroborated the benefits of a relatively dense selectivity layer brought about by the co-deposition of PDA/PEI. Therefore, it can be concluded that similar results on MgSO4 rejection between the NF 270 and LBL-cPP membranes were due to different dominant rejection mechanisms.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the context provided, here's a step-by-step analysis of how increasing LBL layers and changing crosslinking time might affect pure water permeation:\n\n1.

As a result, the synthesized advanced TFC membranes have ultrahigh high permeances of 52.8 and 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1 while maintaining satisfactorily high rejections of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4, demonstrating a desalination performance superior to the PA TFC nanofiltration membranes reported so far.

The nanobrous hydrogel was prepared via phase inversion by immersing the Kevlar/DMSO dope solution (2 wt%, Fig. S1†) in a water bath. The obtained Kevlar hydrogel is transparent and so (Fig. 1a), comprising three-dimensional (3D) nanobrous networks (Fig. 1c and S2†) and is signicantly different from conventional polymeric membranes (Fig. S3†) in morphology and structure. Besides, the nanobrous hydrogel has a water content of 96.5 wt% which is much higher than the conventional support membrane. Such a high water uptake makes it similar to the free water phase in synthesizing a freestanding PA membrane. Therefore, the hydrogel can be applied as the aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization to enable a homogeneous polymerization. To introduce PIP monomers into the nanobrous hydrogel, PIP monomers was dissolved in the water bath which is used for the phase inversion (Fig. S6a and b†). In this case, the PIP monomers are preloaded in the nanobrous hydrogel during its formation.

In addition, the surface of the hydrogel-TFC membrane is entirely smooth with a nanoscale roughness of nearly 8 nm (Fig. 1g).

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time. This result proves that the aqueous solution volume or total monomer amount control provides an effective way to adjust the reaction kinetics, polymerization window, and polyamide growth. On the other hand, the reaction kinetics can also be reflected by the consumption rate of trimesoyl chloride, which can be obtained by in situ monitoring its concentration change according to the positive linear relationship between the concentration and the absorbance peak of the organic solution at 290 nm (Figs. S8 and S9). Lower trimesoyl chloride was consumed with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time, indicating that the participation of trimesoyl chloride in the reaction can also be controlled. These results mean that the reaction between the two monomers can be confined remarkably by limiting the total amount of the diamine monomer solution, which accounts for the reduced thickness of polyamide nanofilms (Fig. 2). According to the monitoring of the reaction kinetics of interfacial polymerization, the regulation mechanism is proposed (Fig. 3D). At the initial stage of the reaction, a high local piperazine concentration can promote the reaction between piperazine and trimesoyl chloride to form an integral nanofilm. Subsequently, as the piperazine is consumed, the total piperazine amount decreases rapidly and the reaction is terminated at a relatively earlier stage of interfacial polymerization, avoiding the further growth of the nanofilm.

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time. This result proves that the aqueous solution volume or total monomer amount control provides an effective way to adjust the reaction kinetics, polymerization window, and polyamide growth. On the other hand, the reaction kinetics can also be reflected by the consumption rate of trimesoyl chloride, which can be obtained by in situ monitoring its concentration change according to the positive linear relationship between the concentration and the absorbance peak of the organic solution at 290 nm (Figs. S8 and S9). Lower trimesoyl chloride was consumed with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time, indicating that the participation of trimesoyl chloride in the reaction can also be controlled. These results mean that the reaction between the two monomers can be confined remarkably by limiting the total amount of the diamine monomer solution, which accounts for the reduced thickness of polyamide nanofilms (Fig. 2). According to the monitoring of the reaction kinetics of interfacial polymerization, the regulation mechanism is proposed (Fig. 3D). At the initial stage of the reaction, a high local piperazine concentration can promote the reaction between piperazine and trimesoyl chloride to form an integral nanofilm. Subsequently, as the piperazine is consumed, the total piperazine amount decreases rapidly and the reaction is terminated at a relatively earlier stage of interfacial polymerization, avoiding the further growth of the nanofilm.

And explain the role of nanovesicles in enhancing water permeance.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nTo comprehensively rationalize the observed separation performances, we initially reassess the design of the bioinspired SWRO membranes. Characterization results demonstrate that the nanovesicleintegrated PA selective layer differs significantly from its nanovesiclefree counterpart. Traditionally, amine monomers undergo diffusion across the aqueous phase to react with the organic monomers at the immiscible interface, forming a dense selective layer with minimal nanovoids and restricted effective surface area. This results in relatively low water permeance and moderate salt rejection. Nevertheless, the incorporation of E. coli-based liposomes via conventional blending or spray-assisted predeposition increases the diffusion rate and penetration depth of amine monomers into the organic phase. This effect is mainly owing to the creation of a broader “miscible region” at the reaction interface, driven by lower interfacial tension, which results in a PA morphology with greater protuberance and a rougher structure (Fig. 7a). In the BM-Conv and BM-spray membranes, this crumpled structure, characterized by a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, along with the lower hydrodynamic resistance from increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer, collectively facilitates the water transport of the liposomesincorporated membranes. However, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes due to the increased monomer supply and the local temperature rise can destabilize incipient PA oligomers, leading to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix.

The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius.

The PES substrate presented a smooth and porous surface morphology, while a rough and compact surface with irregular topography was observed for the cLBL membrane (Fig. 4(B)). This characterization once again confirms a full coverage of polyelectrolyte depositions on the substrate. This result was vindicated by AFM images that presented increased roughness (Ra) from 2.22 ± 0.78 nm for the PES substrate to 12.62 ± 0.91 nm for the cLBL membrane (Fig. A3). After the introduction of a crosslinked PDA/PEI layer, a rougher surface with grainy and convex nanostructures was observed for the LBL-cPP membrane (Fig. 4 (C) and Fig. A3(D)). This indicated fewer visible PDA aggregates were deposited on the LBL layer. This phenomenon could be attributed to the diminishing of non-covalent interactions in the PDA aggregates caused by nucleophilic amine groups of the PEI molecules [27]. Meanwhile, the aggregation of PDA was also disrupted by the size control-inhibition mechanism of polyelectrolytes as discussed above. Eventually, the PDA/PEI deposition layer tailored the NF membrane with a homogeneous surface. By referencing to the FESEM images, the thickness of the PES substrate and cLBL membrane were compared. After PDA/PEI deposition, the average thickness of the crosslinked PDA/PEI coated LBL layer was increased to 116.1 ± 5.2 nm (Fig. 4 (F)), compared with the single crosslinked LBL layer (thickness of 48.8 ± 5.0 nm in Fig. 4 (E)). The corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4 (G-I)) also confirmed the thickness variations of the coated layers, which revealed that the PDA/PEI deposition layer was uniformly and compactly anchored on the LBL surface.

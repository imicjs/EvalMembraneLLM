{"id": "test-00024", "question": "In the range of 80-200nm, how does the size of the bottom membrane pore size affect the surface morphology of the final RO membrane separation layer formed in the interfacial polymerization reaction?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nTFC Membranes Formed on PCTE. Figure 1 presents the SEM micrographs of the PCTE substrates (top view) and the polyamide films (both top and bottom views). It is important to note that the actual pore size of PCTE-200 and PCTE-800 was approximately 70−90 nm larger than the respective nominal sizes provided by the manufacturer (Table 1). The nominal sizes of other PCTE substrates were reasonably accurate. The top surfaces of polyamide films show leaf-like roughness features whose presence was most obvious for TFC-80 and TFC-100. Increasing the substrate pore size from 100 to 800 nm led to the diminishing of these characteristic features. According to our recent works, the leaf-like features were formed due to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that are encapsulated between the polyamide film and the substrate. Increasing the pore size of the substrate would reduce the confinement effect by the substrate and allow the nanobubbles to escape through the large pores. In contrast to the common belief that leaves grow directly over pores, we observed smooth and flat polyamide films spanning over the pores of 80−200 nm (highlighted by the dotted circles in Figure 2). Indeed, the leaf-like features developed predominantly around the pores. Although these observations appear to be peculiar and counterintuitive, they are consistent with the interfacial degassing theory. Due to the release of heat and H+ during the IP reaction, the dissolved bicarbonate will be degassed (see ref 37 and Supporting Information S4). This degassing can possibly happen both inside the substrate pores and at the vicinity of the pores.

Here's a structured explanation of the principle:\n\n1. **Ultrasonic Wave Propagation**: Ultrasonic waves, with frequencies beyond human hearing, propagate through a liquid medium. These waves cause rapid compression and rarefaction (expansion) of the liquid molecules.\n\n2. **Bubble Formation**: During the rarefaction phase, the pressure in the liquid decreases. If this pressure drops below the liquid's vapor pressure, tiny bubbles (cavitation bubbles) form due to localized vaporization.\n\n3. **Bubble Growth and Collapse**: The bubbles grow as the ultrasonic wave continues to act on them.

The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34].

After thorough rinsing and sonication to remove unabsorbed dye, the support of the NF membrane was dissolved using DMAc to isolate the PA separation layer, ensuring it was thin enough for TEM analysis.\n\n3. **EDS Mapping**: Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was performed to visualize the distribution of sulfur atoms from the Orange II dye, indicating the locations of positive charges on the membrane surface.\n\n4. **K-Nearest Neighbor Method**: To quantify the uniformity, the K-nearest neighbor method was applied to the EDS mapping data. For each sulfur atom (target point), the distances to the K nearest neighbor points were calculated. The total average distance provided information on the density of sulfur points, while the standard deviation of these distances indicated the uniformity of the distribution.\n\nThis method allowed for a detailed characterization of both the density and uniformity of positive charges on the NF membrane surface, providing valuable insights into the membrane's charge distribution properties.", "correct": false}

The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane.

The impact of applied pressure on the water ux and Na2SO4 was rstly investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the water uxes improve  proportionally with increasing the pressure from 2 bar to 8 bar but tend to level off at higher pressures while the rejection of Na2SO4 reduced due to concentration polarization. More specically, TFC membranes synthesized by using PIP concentrations of 0.0175 wt% and 0.015 wt% have an ultrahigh water ux of 211.2 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 52.8 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) and 251.6 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) under 4 bar, respectively, while maintaining a satisfactorily high rejection of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4. Such a high permeability is expected to originate from the reduced thickness of the thin selective PA layer, improved negative charges, and defect-free thin PA layer resulting from the homogeneous interfacial polymerization at the perfect interface between hexane and the nanobrous hydrogel, which will be fully discussed in the following section. The desalination performance of these two hydrogel-TFC membranes was compared with other membranes reported in 28 top cited published papers in the last 3 years in Fig. 2b. The comparison graph suggests that the performance of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is, to a large extent, superior to all other membranes (Table S5†). Such a high performance has the potential to further reduce the energy demand of the current desalination process from the perspective of the membrane.4 It is also noted that the hydrogel based TFC membrane can even maintain a good Na2SO4 rejection under 8 bar although the brous hydrogel has a weak tensile strength of 0.185 0.021 MPa (Fig. S5†), which is mainly due to the strong interaction between the thin selective PA layer and the nanobrous hydrogel. The rejection of four salts (Na2SO4, MgSO4, MgCl2, and NaCl) was measured. The hydrogel-TFC membranes have a much higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 than MgCl2 and NaCl (Fig. 2c) due to the relatively larger size of the sulfate ions compared with the other three ions. Besides, hydrogel-TFC membranes are negatively charged which also contribute to the higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 due to the Donnan effect. With the decrease of PIP concentration from 0.04 wt% to 0.01 wt%, a sharp reduction in the rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 is observed.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The characterization technique that provided direct evidence of nanochannels around AgNPs in TFN membranes is **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**.

For instance, at pH 4.0 and I = 1 mM, the |ζ| is relatively low due to weak membrane charge with the accompanying reduced Donnan effects, which results in relatively high ion permeability (Fig. 4b). At pH 7.5 and high ionic strength, the |ζ| is greater and consequently ion permeability is reduced. The main reason for the lower permeability under these conditions is schematically explained in Fig. 4c, showing higher membrane charge, which is partly neutralized by the ions. At pH 7.5 and low ionic strength (Fig. 4d), there is limited charge screening, therefore many membrane charges generate strong Donnan effects resulting in very low permeability. The ZP results may also imply subtle differences in Donnan exclusion experienced by Li+ and Cs+, as reflected by the good correlation between the ratios of LiCl and CsCl ζ (rζ 1⁄4 ζLiCl=ζCsCl) and Ps (rP 1⁄4 PsðLiClÞ=PsðCsClÞ).

{"id": "test-00086", "question": "How will the pure water permeation change if we increase the number of LBL layers? How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction. A systematic investigation of these parameters will be a focus in our future studies. Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)).

This smoothness reduces fouling, maintaining high permeability over time by preventing the accumulation of particles or biological matter.\n\n5. **Chemical Compatibility Between Layers**: The hydrogel and PA layer share similar chemical groups and compositions, leading to a robust interaction. This compatibility ensures a well-integrated and stable membrane structure, reducing interfacial resistance.\n\n6. **Efficient and Scalable Production Method**: The simplified production process allows for the efficient creation of large pieces of hydrogel-TFC membrane. This scalability is crucial for commercial applications, ensuring consistent performance on a larger scale.\n\nIn summary, the hydrogel-TFC membrane's superior permeability is achieved through its high water content, streamlined polymerization process, thin and defect-free PA layer, smooth surface, chemical compatibility, and efficient production method. These factors collectively contribute to reducing resistance to water flow and minimizing fouling, resulting in a membrane with exceptional permeability.", "correct": false}

{"id": "test-00103", "question": "What was the key advantage of using short chain amino-rich monomers (SCA) over conventional macro-monomers (ARM)?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nInterestingly, the high Mg2+ rejection and high Li + permeability led to the PA-g-TETA membrane to possess an extremely high SLi,Mg of all above 90 in the WMg2+/Li + range of 5:1–200:1. The SLi,Mg even reached above 130 while treating the feed with a high WMg2+/Li+ of 200. The above phenomena were different from the reported results that the Mg2+ rejection was obviously decreased with the increase in WMg2+/Li+ in literature. The surprising results linked to the uniformity of charge distribution on the surface of TETA grafted PA membrane, which may be explained as follows and illustrated from the schematic diagram in Fig. 8. It was known that Mg2+ and Li+ in mixed salt system easily existed in the form of ion clusters of Mg2+/Li+/nCl⋅H2O.

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time. This result proves that the aqueous solution volume or total monomer amount control provides an effective way to adjust the reaction kinetics, polymerization window, and polyamide growth.

For membrane PA-100, the rejections of CaCl2, MgCl2 and MgSO4 were 94.3, 95.2 and 91.6%, respectively. However, the rejections of Na2SO4 and NaCl were only 65.3 and 36.4, respectively. The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius. When tested using salt solution with a higher concentration 2000 ppm, the membrane still showed good rejection of MgCl2 and MgSO4, with a rejection rate of 94.1 and 91.5%, respectively. However, the consistently relatively lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 at both feed concentrations could not be fully explained using the steric hindrance effect. To further understand the salt rejection results, the surface charge of the membranes were measured and the zeta potential results are presented in Fig. 11. The zeta potential of the tubular membrane was measured using the streaming potential method at pH ranging from 3 to 9.5. The ceramic substrate had an isoelectric point at about pH 5, exhibiting anionic surface charge under pH > 5.

{"id": "test-00120", "question": "Explain the mechanism behind the improved RO performance when using LBL-cPP permeate as feed.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nDue to superior rejection of the LBLcPP membrane, the permeate of LBL-cPP presented lower TOC  (∼90.6% lower), Ca2+ (∼76.9% lower), Mg2+ (∼95.6% lower) and  Na+ (∼40.4% lower) as compared to the feed solution, which was better than that of NF 270 and cLBL processes. The EEM fluorescence spectra provide better understanding of the organic compositions in the permeate for each process as well as its surface foulants. As depicted in Fig. 10 (A), the EEM plots for feed solution were classified into four sections - I (humic-like substances; Ex > 280 nm, Em > 380 nm), II (protein-like substances; Ex = 250–280 nm, Em < 380 nm), III (fulvic acid-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em > 380 nm), and IV (tyrosine-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em = 330–380 nm) [51]. A distinct peak for tyrosine-like substances (IV) could be observed in feed solution, which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids. After the filtrations, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV) decreased by 84.2%, 89.3% and 93.9% for the permeates of the NF 270, cLBL and LBL-cPP membranes, respectively, compared to the feed solution, indicating better removal efficiency for tyrosine-like substances. In particular, the LBL-cPP membrane presented significant removal efficiency (decreased by 96.1%) for protein-like substances (II) from the feed solution, which was confirmed by its almost disappearing peak intensity (Fig. 10 (A)). Hence, the LBL-cPP membrane has a higher capacity to provide better permeate quality.

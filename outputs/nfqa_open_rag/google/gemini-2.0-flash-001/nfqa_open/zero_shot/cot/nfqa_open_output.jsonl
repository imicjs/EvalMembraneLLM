However, this huge O/N ratio difference is not observed on PIP/TMC membrane. This can be attributed to the significant molecular size difference between PIP and PEI. In a typical interfacial polymerization process, the small amine monomers (PIP) can easily pass through the nascent polyamide film into the organic phase to continuously react with TMC until a thick and dense polyamide layer is formed. However, the branched PEI with a molecular weight of 70000 Da is much larger than that of PIP (Mw = 86 Da), thus much more difficult to pass the nascent polyamide films to react with acyl chloride monomer (Fig. 2b and c). It is more likely that just part of the PEI branches pass the nascent polyamide film and join in the reaction, while  the other part of PEI was left in the aqueous phase side, resulting in an insufficient amine groups in organic phase.

This difference arises from variations in the chemical composition and functional groups present on each surface. In the context of the provided text, the key factors contributing to this phenomenon are:\n\n1.  **Monomer Size and Diffusion:** The size difference between the amine monomers (PIP vs. PEI) plays a crucial role.

This allows them to react more completely with the acyl chloride monomer (TMC) on both sides of the membrane. Larger monomers like PEI, however, have difficulty diffusing through the nascent polyamide layer.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Reaction and Hydrolysis:** Because PEI is large and doesn't diffuse as readily, the reaction with TMC is less complete on the organic phase side.

The nominal sizes of other PCTE substrates were reasonably accurate. The top surfaces of polyamide films show leaf-like roughness features whose presence was most obvious for TFC-80 and TFC-100. Increasing the substrate pore size from 100 to 800 nm led to the diminishing of these characteristic features. According to our recent works, the leaf-like features were formed due to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that are encapsulated between the polyamide film and the substrate. Increasing the pore size of the substrate would reduce the confinement effect by the substrate and allow the nanobubbles to escape through the large pores.

Indeed, the leaf-like features developed predominantly around the pores.

The confinement effect by the solid matrix around the pores allows the CO2 nanobubbles to be retained, which shapes the leaf-like roughness features. However, the confinement effect was the weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, which prevents effective retention of degassed nanobubbles.

These features are attributed to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that become trapped between the polyamide film and the substrate.\n\n*   **Confinement Effect:** The key factor influencing the surface morphology is the \"confinement effect\" of the substrate around the pores. Smaller pores provide a stronger confinement effect, which helps retain the CO2 nanobubbles and shapes the leaf-like roughness.\n\n*   **Smooth Polyamide Over Pores:** Counterintuitively, the polyamide film tends to be smooth and flat *over* the pores themselves in the 80-200 nm range. This is because the confinement effect is weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, allowing the nanobubbles to escape more easily.\n\n*   **Roughness Around Pores:** The leaf-like features develop *around* the pores, not directly on top of them.

Therefore, our study further confirms the critical importance of the substrate confinement effect in shaping the polyamide surface roughness. This confinement effect also explains why surface roughness could not effectively develop for polyamide films formed at free interfaces. With a further increase of substrate pore size to 800 nm, the polyamide intruded into the substrate due to a lack of effective support (see the bottom view of TFC-800 in Figure 1).\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, based on the provided context, here's how the bottom membrane pore size in the 80-200 nm range affects the surface morphology of the polyamide separation layer formed during interfacial polymerization (IP) in the context of thin-film composite (TFC) RO membranes:\n\n*   **Leaf-like Roughness:** The study indicates that leaf-like roughness features are more pronounced when the bottom membrane pore size is smaller (e.g., 80-100 nm). These features are attributed to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that become trapped between the polyamide film and the substrate.\n\n*   **Confinement Effect:** The key factor influencing the surface morphology is the \"confinement effect\" of the substrate around the pores. Smaller pores provide a stronger confinement effect, which helps retain the CO2 nanobubbles and shapes the leaf-like roughness.\n\n*   **Smooth Polyamide Over Pores:** Counterintuitively, the polyamide film tends to be smooth and flat *over* the pores themselves in the 80-200 nm range. This is because the confinement effect is weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, allowing the nanobubbles to escape more easily.\n\n*   **Roughness Around Pores:** The leaf-like features develop *around* the pores, not directly on top of them. This is because the solid matrix surrounding the pores provides the necessary confinement to retain the CO2 nanobubbles.\n\n*   **Increasing Pore Size:** As the pore size increases within the 80-200 nm range, the confinement effect weakens, and the leaf-like features tend to diminish.\n\nIn summary, in the 80-200 nm range, smaller pore sizes lead to more pronounced leaf-like roughness features due to a stronger confinement effect that traps CO2 nanobubbles.

You're asking about the effect of bottom membrane pore size (in the range of 10-80 nm) on the surface morphology (specifically roughness) of the polyamide separation layer formed during interfacial polymerization in RO membrane fabrication. You're also noting that the trend observed in this range is *opposite* to what's seen with larger pore sizes (80-200 nm, although the provided text doesn't explicitly discuss this range, it's implied). The provided text suggests two competing mechanisms are at play.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the bottom membrane pore size affects surface morphology in the 10-80 nm range, and why it's the opposite of what's expected at larger pore sizes:\n\n**1. The Observed Trend (10-80 nm):**\n\n*   **Increasing pore size (10 nm -> 80 nm) leads to *increased* surface roughness.** The text notes that the TFC-10 membrane (10 nm pores) had barely noticeable roughness features, while TFC-30, TFC-50, and TFC-80 showed increasingly larger roughness.\n\n**2. Explanation Based on the Provided Context:**\n\n*   **MPD Storage and Diffusion:** Larger pores (within this range) allow for greater storage of MPD (m-phenylenediamine, the aqueous monomer) within the pores of the support membrane. This increased MPD storage also leads to enhanced MPD diffusion.\n*   **Interfacial Degassing Theory:** A higher concentration of MPD at the reaction interface (where MPD reacts with the organic monomer, typically TMC) leads to a more vigorous reaction. This vigorous reaction generates more heat, which promotes the release of CO2 nanobubbles. These nanobubbles contribute to the formation of a rougher surface.\n*   **\"Volcanic\" Eruption of MPD:** The text mentions an earlier theory of \"volcanic\" eruption of MPD, where MPD erupts from the pores. While the text argues this model alone is insufficient, it still contributes to the overall roughness.\n\n**3. The Competing Mechanisms:**\n\nThe text highlights two competing mechanisms:\n\n*   **Roughness Promoter: Greater MPD Storage:** As explained above, larger pores in the 10-80 nm range lead to greater MPD storage, which promotes a more vigorous reaction and increased roughness.\n*   **Roughness Inhibitor: Reduced Confinement Effect:** This is the key to understanding the opposite trend. The text mentions that larger pores lead to a reduced confinement effect. This confinement effect is likely related to the physical constraint imposed by the smaller pores. Smaller pores restrict the movement and expansion of the polyamide film during formation, leading to a smoother surface. As the pore size increases, this confinement is reduced, allowing for more freedom in the polyamide film formation and thus a rougher surface.\n\n**4. Why the Opposite Trend at Larger Pore Sizes (80-200 nm, inferred):**\n\nThe question states that the trend is opposite at larger pore sizes (80-200 nm). This implies that *increasing* pore size in this range leads to *decreased* surface roughness. The text doesn't explicitly explain this, but we can infer the following:\n\n*   **Confinement Effect Dominates:** At larger pore sizes (80-200 nm), the \"reduced confinement effect\" becomes the *dominant* factor. The pores are now so large that the MPD storage benefit plateaus or becomes less significant compared to the lack of confinement. The polyamide film is essentially forming over a relatively open space, leading to less localized pressure and a more relaxed, potentially smoother, structure.\n*   **MPD Diffusion Limitations:** It's also possible that at very large pore sizes, the MPD diffusion becomes less controlled. Instead of a concentrated reaction at the interface, the MPD might diffuse too quickly and spread out, leading to a less vigorous and more uniform reaction, resulting in a smoother surface.\n*   **Support Structure Collapse:** In extreme cases, very large pores might lead to a collapse of the support structure during the interfacial polymerization process, which could also affect the surface morphology in unpredictable ways.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **10-80 nm:** Increasing pore size increases roughness because the increased MPD storage and diffusion outweigh the reduced confinement effect.\n*   **80-200 nm (inferred):** Increasing pore size decreases roughness because the reduced confinement effect becomes the dominant factor, leading to a more relaxed polyamide film formation.\n\nTherefore, the key to understanding the opposite trends lies in the interplay between MPD storage/diffusion and the confinement effect imposed by the pore size of the support membrane.

This means the pressure in the liquid fluctuates rapidly.\n\n2.  **Cavitation Bubble Formation (Nucleation):** During the rarefaction (thinning) phase, the pressure drops significantly. If the pressure becomes lower than the tensile strength of the liquid, tiny voids or bubbles, known as cavitation bubbles, are formed. These bubbles essentially represent a localized \"tearing\" of the liquid due to the extreme negative pressure.\n\n3.  **Bubble Growth and Compression:** Once formed, these cavitation bubbles grow as they continue to experience the alternating pressure waves. They expand during rarefaction and compress during compression phases.\n\n4.  **Bubble Collapse:** Eventually, the cavitation bubbles reach a critical size where they become unstable. They then violently collapse.\n\n5.  **Localized High Energy Release:** The collapse of cavitation bubbles is not a gentle process. It's extremely rapid and generates intense localized effects:\n\n    *   **High Temperature:** The implosion of the bubble compresses the gas and vapor inside, leading to extremely high temperatures (thousands of degrees Kelvin) within the bubble.\n    *   **High Pressure:** Similarly, the collapse generates very high pressures (hundreds or thousands of atmospheres) within the bubble and in its immediate vicinity.\n    *   **Acoustochemical Environment:** The extreme conditions create a high-energy environment that can induce chemical reactions and physical changes in the surrounding liquid.\n\n**In summary, the principle of ultrasonic cavitation involves the formation, growth, and violent collapse of bubbles in a liquid due to alternating pressure waves generated by ultrasound.

The polyamide composite membranes fabricated by piperazine with a common concentration of 34.8 mM and limited total amount show both high water permeance and Na2SO4  rejection, which is superior to those membranes by the same total monomer amount but lower concentration, or the same concentration but higher total amount (Figs. S11 and S12). The differences in membrane performance stem from the structures of polyamide nanofilms formed under varying reaction conditions. A high concentration and limited amount of piperazine facilitate the formation of ultrathin and integral polyamide nanofilms. In contrast, both a high concentration and amount of piperazine yield dense but thick nanofilms, while a low concentration and limited amount of piperazine result in thin but defective nanofilms.

The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29].

Defining Stoichiometric Equilibrium in Interfacial Polymerization (PIP/TMC):**\n\n*   **Balance of Reactants:** Stoichiometric equilibrium in this context means that the molar ratio of PIP in the aqueous phase reacting with TMC in the organic phase at the interface is optimized for complete or near-complete reaction of both monomers.  Ideally, neither monomer is significantly in excess.\n\n*   **Reaction Rates:**  The rates at which PIP diffuses to the interface and reacts with TMC, and vice versa, are balanced. This prevents one monomer from being consumed much faster than the other, which could lead to chain termination or incomplete polymerization.\n\n*   **Concentration Ratios:** The concentrations of PIP and TMC in their respective phases are such that, considering their diffusion rates and reactivity, they meet at the interface in approximately stoichiometric proportions. This doesn't necessarily mean equal concentrations in the bulk phases, as diffusion coefficients and partition coefficients play a role.\n\n*   **In simpler terms:** It's the \"Goldilocks\" zone where you have just the right amount of each reactant meeting at the interface to form the best possible polymer network.\n\n**2. Structural Characteristics at Stoichiometric Equilibrium:**\n\n*   **Narrow Network Pore Structure:**  When the reaction is stoichiometrically balanced, the polymer chains crosslink efficiently and regularly. This leads to a dense, tightly packed network with small, uniform pores. The context mentions this directly.\n\n*   **Inhibition of Large Aggregate Pores:**  Excess of one monomer can lead to the formation of larger polymer aggregates or voids within the membrane structure. Stoichiometric equilibrium minimizes this, resulting in a more homogeneous and defect-free film.\n\n*   **Regular Network Structure (with SLS):** The addition of a surfactant like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) further enhances the uniformity of the reaction. SLS likely helps to emulsify the organic phase, increasing the interfacial area and promoting a more even distribution of TMC. This leads to a more regular and well-defined network structure at the nanoscale.\n\n**3. Performance Characteristics at Stoichiometric Equilibrium:**\n\n*   **High Selectivity:** The narrow, uniform pore size distribution resulting from stoichiometric equilibrium is crucial for achieving high selectivity in separation applications. The membrane can effectively discriminate between molecules based on size and/or charge.\n\n*   **High Permeance/Flux (Potentially):** While a dense structure might seem to imply low permeance, the uniformity and lack of defects can actually lead to higher permeance compared to a membrane with larger, irregular pores. The key is to optimize the pore size for the target application.\n\n*   **Improved Mechanical Strength:** A well-crosslinked, homogeneous polymer network generally exhibits better mechanical strength and stability.\n\n*   **Enhanced Stability:** The absence of large voids or defects makes the membrane more resistant to fouling and degradation.\n\n**In summary:** Stoichiometric equilibrium in interfacial polymerization is a critical condition for creating high-performance membranes.

Ideally, neither monomer is significantly in excess.\n\n*   **Reaction Rates:**  The rates at which PIP diffuses to the interface and reacts with TMC, and vice versa, are balanced. This prevents one monomer from being consumed much faster than the other, which could lead to chain termination or incomplete polymerization.\n\n*   **Concentration Ratios:** The concentrations of PIP and TMC in their respective phases are such that, considering their diffusion rates and reactivity, they meet at the interface in approximately stoichiometric proportions. This doesn't necessarily mean equal concentrations in the bulk phases, as diffusion coefficients and partition coefficients play a role.\n\n*   **In simpler terms:** It's the \"Goldilocks\" zone where you have just the right amount of each reactant meeting at the interface to form the best possible polymer network.\n\n**2. Structural Characteristics at Stoichiometric Equilibrium:**\n\n*   **Narrow Network Pore Structure:**  When the reaction is stoichiometrically balanced, the polymer chains crosslink efficiently and regularly. This leads to a dense, tightly packed network with small, uniform pores. The context mentions this directly.\n\n*   **Inhibition of Large Aggregate Pores:**  Excess of one monomer can lead to the formation of larger polymer aggregates or voids within the membrane structure. Stoichiometric equilibrium minimizes this, resulting in a more homogeneous and defect-free film.\n\n*   **Regular Network Structure (with SLS):** The addition of a surfactant like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) further enhances the uniformity of the reaction. SLS likely helps to emulsify the organic phase, increasing the interfacial area and promoting a more even distribution of TMC. This leads to a more regular and well-defined network structure at the nanoscale.\n\n**3. Performance Characteristics at Stoichiometric Equilibrium:**\n\n*   **High Selectivity:** The narrow, uniform pore size distribution resulting from stoichiometric equilibrium is crucial for achieving high selectivity in separation applications. The membrane can effectively discriminate between molecules based on size and/or charge.\n\n*   **High Permeance/Flux (Potentially):** While a dense structure might seem to imply low permeance, the uniformity and lack of defects can actually lead to higher permeance compared to a membrane with larger, irregular pores. The key is to optimize the pore size for the target application.\n\n*   **Improved Mechanical Strength:** A well-crosslinked, homogeneous polymer network generally exhibits better mechanical strength and stability.\n\n*   **Enhanced Stability:** The absence of large voids or defects makes the membrane more resistant to fouling and degradation.\n\n**In summary:** Stoichiometric equilibrium in interfacial polymerization is a critical condition for creating high-performance membranes. By carefully controlling the concentrations and reaction conditions to achieve a balanced reaction between the monomers, it's possible to tailor the membrane structure and properties for specific applications. The addition of surfactants like SLS can further refine the structure and improve performance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stoichiometric equilibrium in the interfacial polymerization of PIP and TMC refers to a state where the molar ratio of the two monomers reacting at the interface is optimized for a complete and balanced reaction.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to calculate the diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the free water and in the nanobrous hydrogel (Fig. 4a and b). The diffusion coefficients of the PIP molecules can be estimated from the slope of the mean square displacement (MSD) curves in Fig. 4c by the Einstein relationship.35 The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in water (6.0 10 10 m2 s 1) agrees well with the experimental results (6.07 10 10 m2 s 1 at 1.46 mol L 1, 298.15 K) in aqueous solution, which conrms the accuracy of our MD simulations. The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel is 4.3 10 10 m2 s 1, 28.3% lower than that in the water, conrming our hypothesis in the explanation of the ultrahigh water permeability of hydrogel-TFC membranes in the previous section. The relatively low PIP diffusion rate in the nanobrous Kevlar hydrogel is mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar networks; this also affects the interfacial polymerization. Therefore, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations were carried out to investigate the interfacial polymerization on the nanobrous hydrogel. The snapshots of the initial simulation system before the interfacial polymerization process, as well as the equilibrium state of the system aer the interfacial polymerization process are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, PIP monomers are well dispersed in water and the hydrogel before interfacial polymerization. Aer a simulation of 500 000 steps to reach the equilibrium state of the system, all the PIP monomers moved to the interface of free n-hexane and free water in the free water/n-hexane system (Fig. 5b). In contrast, there were still many PIP monomers left in the hydrogel without moving to the interface in the Kevlar hydrogel/ n-hexane system (Fig. 5d), indicating a lower diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel. More specically, the PIP monomers remaining in the hydrogel preferentially attached on the Kevlar molecules, which conrmed the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar network. In addition, compared to the thin selective layer in Fig. 5b, the active layer formed in the hydrogel system is thought to be thinner than that in the water system, due to the strong interaction between PIP and the Kevlar network.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The MD simulations calculated the diffusion rate of PIP monomers in both free water and the nanofibrous hydrogel.

{"id": "test-00086", "question": "How will the pure water permeation change if we increase the number of LBL layers? How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction.

Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)).

Here, an innovative approach to design thin film composite (TFC) membranes with ultrahigh permeance via hydrogel assisted interfacial polymerization is reported. The hydrogel containing piperazine (PIP) monomers serving as an aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization enable homogeneous interfacial polymerization, reducing the diffusion rate of the PIP monomers, and providing mechanical strength to the thin polyamide (PA) selective layer.

The nanobrous hydrogel was prepared via phase inversion by immersing the Kevlar/DMSO dope solution (2 wt%, Fig. S1†) in a water bath. The obtained Kevlar hydrogel is transparent and so (Fig. 1a), comprising three-dimensional (3D) nanobrous networks (Fig. 1c and S2†) and is signicantly different from conventional polymeric membranes (Fig. S3†) in morphology and structure. Besides, the nanobrous hydrogel has a water content of 96.5 wt% which is much higher than the conventional support membrane. Such a high water uptake makes it similar to the free water phase in synthesizing a freestanding PA membrane. Therefore, the hydrogel can be applied as the aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization to enable a homogeneous polymerization. To introduce PIP monomers into the nanobrous hydrogel, PIP monomers was dissolved in the water bath which is used for the phase inversion (Fig. S6a and b†). In this case, the PIP monomers are preloaded in the nanobrous hydrogel during its formation.

Here's a breakdown of the factors involved:\n\n**1. Osmotic Pressure:**\n\n*   **Increased Ion Concentration = Increased Osmotic Pressure:** Higher ion concentrations on one side of the membrane (the feed side) create a higher osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure acts as a driving force *against* the flow of water through the membrane.\n*   **Reduced Net Driving Force:** The effective driving force for water permeation is the difference between the applied pressure and the osmotic pressure. As osmotic pressure increases, the net driving force decreases, potentially reducing water flux (and thus, apparent permeability if you're not accounting for the changing driving force).\n\n**2. Concentration Polarization:**\n\n*   **Build-up at Membrane Surface:** As water permeates through the membrane, ions are retained. This leads to a higher concentration of ions near the membrane surface on the feed side than in the bulk feed solution. This phenomenon is called concentration polarization.\n*   **Enhanced Osmotic Pressure Effect:** Concentration polarization exacerbates the osmotic pressure effect described above, further hindering water permeation.\n*   **Fouling:** High ion concentrations can also contribute to scaling and fouling on the membrane surface, which physically blocks pores and reduces permeability.\n\n**3. Membrane Properties and Ion-Membrane Interactions:**\n\n*   **Charge Effects:** NF membranes are often charged (typically negatively charged). The presence of ions in the feed water can influence the membrane's surface charge and its interaction with other ions.\n*   **Swelling/Compaction:** High ionic strength solutions can affect the swelling or compaction of the membrane polymer matrix. This can alter the pore size and structure of the membrane, influencing water permeability. For example, divalent cations can crosslink with the membrane functional groups, leading to membrane compaction and reduced water permeability.\n*   **Donnan Effect:** The Donnan effect describes the unequal distribution of ions between the membrane and the external solution due to the presence of fixed charges on the membrane. This can influence the local ion concentrations within the membrane and affect water transport.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nIncreased ion concentration in the feed water generally *decreases* the observed water permeability of NF membranes due to:\n\n*   Increased osmotic pressure opposing water flow.\n*   Concentration polarization amplifying the osmotic pressure effect.\n*   Potential for scaling and fouling.\n*   Alterations in membrane structure (swelling/compaction) due to ion-membrane interactions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific effect of ion concentration will depend on:\n\n*   The type and concentration of ions present.\n*   The properties of the NF membrane (material, charge, pore size, hydrophobicity).\n*   Operating conditions (pressure, temperature, crossflow velocity).\n\nTherefore, when evaluating the water permeability of an NF membrane, it's crucial to consider and, if possible, control or account for the ionic strength of the feed solution.", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful membrane science assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: How does ion concentration in water affect water permeability of NF membranes of NF membranes?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nNanofiltration also has other high temperature applications: in the textile industry, water used for bleaching and dyeing may reach temperatures up to 90 °C; in the pulp and paper industry, the water temperature is often above 60 °C.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will address how ion concentration in water affects the water permeability of nanofiltration (NF) membranes.

This phenomenon is called concentration polarization.\n*   **Enhanced Osmotic Pressure Effect:** Concentration polarization exacerbates the osmotic pressure effect described above, further hindering water permeation.\n*   **Fouling:** High ion concentrations can also contribute to scaling and fouling on the membrane surface, which physically blocks pores and reduces permeability.\n\n**3. Membrane Properties and Ion-Membrane Interactions:**\n\n*   **Charge Effects:** NF membranes are often charged (typically negatively charged). The presence of ions in the feed water can influence the membrane's surface charge and its interaction with other ions.\n*   **Swelling/Compaction:** High ionic strength solutions can affect the swelling or compaction of the membrane polymer matrix. This can alter the pore size and structure of the membrane, influencing water permeability. For example, divalent cations can crosslink with the membrane functional groups, leading to membrane compaction and reduced water permeability.\n*   **Donnan Effect:** The Donnan effect describes the unequal distribution of ions between the membrane and the external solution due to the presence of fixed charges on the membrane. This can influence the local ion concentrations within the membrane and affect water transport.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nIncreased ion concentration in the feed water generally *decreases* the observed water permeability of NF membranes due to:\n\n*   Increased osmotic pressure opposing water flow.\n*   Concentration polarization amplifying the osmotic pressure effect.\n*   Potential for scaling and fouling.\n*   Alterations in membrane structure (swelling/compaction) due to ion-membrane interactions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific effect of ion concentration will depend on:\n\n*   The type and concentration of ions present.\n*   The properties of the NF membrane (material, charge, pore size, hydrophobicity).\n*   Operating conditions (pressure, temperature, crossflow velocity).\n\nTherefore, when evaluating the water permeability of an NF membrane, it's crucial to consider and, if possible, control or account for the ionic strength of the feed solution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Increased ion concentration in the feed water generally decreases the observed water permeability of NF membranes due to increased osmotic pressure, concentration polarization, potential for scaling/fouling, and alterations in membrane structure."}], "response": "Increased ion concentration in the feed water generally decreases the observed water permeability of NF membranes due to increased osmotic pressure, concentration polarization, potential for scaling/fouling, and alterations in membrane structure.", "confidence": [], "prediction": "Increased ion concentration in the feed water generally decreases the observed water permeability of NF membranes due to increased osmotic pressure, concentration polarization, potential for scaling/fouling, and alterations in membrane structure.", "correct": false}

The key is that these rates are tuned in such a way that a *stable, homogeneous* state becomes *unstable*, leading to the spontaneous formation of spatial patterns. This instability is driven by the interplay of local activation and lateral inhibition.\n\n**1. Local Activation:**\n\n*   **What it is:** This refers to a process where one substance (the activator) promotes its *own* production or the production of another substance that further enhances its own production. It's a positive feedback loop.\n*   **In the context of the provided text:** Piperazine (PZ) acts as the activator. It reacts with trimesoyl chloride (TMC) to initiate polymerization. The text doesn't explicitly state that PZ *directly* promotes its own production. However, we can infer that the initial reaction of PZ with TMC creates a local environment that favors further reaction of PZ. This could be due to changes in local pH, surface properties, or the creation of reactive intermediates that facilitate further PZ reaction. The initial reaction of PZ with TMC can be considered as the local activation step.\n\n**2. Lateral Inhibition:**\n\n*   **What it is:** This is a process where the activator also promotes the production of a second substance (the inhibitor) that *suppresses* the activator's activity or spread. The inhibitor diffuses faster and further than the activator.\n*   **In the context of the provided text:** Trimesoyl chloride (TMC) acts as the inhibitor. The reaction between PZ and TMC leads to the formation of the polyamide (PA) membrane. As the PA membrane forms, it consumes both PZ and TMC, effectively inhibiting further reaction in that immediate area. The crucial point is that TMC, being dissolved in the organic phase, *can diffuse more rapidly than PZ*, especially when the diffusion of PZ is hindered by the confinement within the pores of the PSU support and the presence of PVA.\n\n**How These Two Processes Create Patterns**\n\n1.  **Initial Perturbation:** Imagine a perfectly uniform distribution of PZ and TMC. A small, random fluctuation causes a slight increase in PZ concentration at one point.\n\n2.  **Local Activation Dominates:** At that point, the increased PZ concentration leads to a faster reaction with TMC, forming more PA. This is the local activation phase.\n\n3.  **Inhibitor Spreads:** The TMC diffuses away from the point of initial activation more quickly than PZ.\n\n4.  **Lateral Inhibition Prevents Runaway Activation:** The faster diffusion of TMC creates a zone around the initial activation point where the TMC concentration is high enough to suppress further PZ reaction. This prevents the initial activation from spreading uncontrollably.\n\n5.  **Pattern Formation:** Because the inhibitor spreads further, it creates a zone of inhibition around the initial activation point. Outside this zone, the activator (PZ) can again accumulate and initiate a new activation point. This interplay of activation and inhibition leads to the formation of spatially separated regions of high and low PA concentration, resulting in the observed spotted or striped Turing patterns.\n\n**The Importance of Diffusion Rates**\n\nThe *difference* in diffusion rates between the activator (PZ) and the inhibitor (TMC) is absolutely critical. The inhibitor *must* diffuse faster than the activator for the lateral inhibition to work effectively. In the described experiment, this is achieved by:\n\n*   **Confinement of PZ:** The aqueous solution of PZ is confined within the nanometer-sized pores of the PSU support, physically hindering its diffusion.\n*   **PVA Interaction:** The addition of PVA to the aqueous solution further reduces the diffusion rate of PZ due to hydrogen bonding and increased viscosity.\n*   **TMC in Organic Solvent:** TMC is dissolved in the organic solvent, allowing for relatively fast diffusion.\n\nWithout these factors to create a significant difference in diffusion rates, the system would not exhibit Turing patterns.

Further studies have revealed that the strength of dielectric exclusion is affected by various factors such as pore geometry, membrane material, and solution  properties, making it challenging to accurately quantify. Numerous studies have attempted to quantify dielectric exclusion, with several comprehensive reviews available in the literature. These studies demonstrate the critical role of dielectric exclusion in membrane selectivity. However, existing models often rely on semiempirical models such as the Bowen model to calculate the membrane permittivity. While mathematically convenient, this approach oversimplifies the system, which may not be compatible with the basic assumptions of NF models. An alternative method involves fitting experimental data to the NF model. The resulting value can then be used as a known parameter for subsequent model predictions, which potentially offers a more accurate representation of the complex interactions within NF membranes.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's break down the context provided to identify the main shortcoming of existing NF models in explaining ion selectivity.\n\nThe passage highlights the evolution of NF models from DSPM to SEDE, emphasizing the increasing importance of dielectric exclusion.

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly.

The PA layer becomes crumpled, leading to a larger surface area.\n*   **Increased Rear Surface Porosity and Larger Nanovoids Size:** The incorporation of nanovesicles leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance from increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer.\n*   **Loosely Cross-linked PA Matrix:** The intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes due to the increased monomer supply and the local temperature rise can destabilize incipient PA oligomers, leading to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix.\n\n**Role of Nanovesicles in Enhancing Water Permeance:**\n\n*   **Larger Surface Area and Enhanced Wettability:** The crumpled structure of the PA layer, resulting from nanovesicle incorporation, provides a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, which facilitates water transport.\n*   **Lower Hydrodynamic Resistance:** Increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer lead to lower hydrodynamic resistance.\n*   **Additional Channels and Non-selective Defects:** The formation of additional channels and non-selective defects between the unreactive liposomes and the PA layer, as well as substrate, due to poor interfacial compatibility, further accounts for the higher water permeance.\n*   **Loosely Cross-linked PA Matrix:** The loosely cross-linked PA matrix contributes to higher water permeance.\n\nIn summary, nanovesicles modify the PA layer morphology by creating a rougher, more porous structure with a larger surface area.

The EEM fluorescence spectra provide better understanding of the organic compositions in the permeate for each process as well as its surface foulants. As depicted in Fig. 10 (A), the EEM plots for feed solution were classified into four sections - I (humic-like substances; Ex > 280 nm, Em > 380 nm), II (protein-like substances; Ex = 250–280 nm, Em < 380 nm), III (fulvic acid-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em > 380 nm), and IV (tyrosine-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em = 330–380 nm) [51]. A distinct peak for tyrosine-like substances (IV) could be observed in feed solution, which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids. After the filtrations, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV) decreased by 84.2%, 89.3% and 93.9% for the permeates of the NF 270, cLBL and LBL-cPP membranes, respectively, compared to the feed solution, indicating better removal efficiency for tyrosine-like substances. In particular, the LBL-cPP membrane presented significant removal efficiency (decreased by 96.1%) for protein-like substances (II) from the feed solution, which was confirmed by its almost disappearing peak intensity (Fig. 10 (A)). Hence, the LBL-cPP membrane has a higher capacity to provide better permeate quality. It should be noted a small amount of fulvic acid-like substances (III) were identified in the permeate of all NF membranes. This is most likely due to their smaller molecular weights than the MWCOs of the NF membranes. Meanwhile, simpler organic compositions were illustrated by the foulant on the surface of the LBL-cPP membrane, which were composed of very small amounts of protein-like substances (II) and part of tyrosine-like substances (IV) that appeared far less than the amount on NF270 and cLBL (Fig. A5). These results were consistent with the flux profile of the LBLcPP membrane.

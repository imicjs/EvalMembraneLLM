This is because PEI is larger, making it harder for the reaction to proceed. In contrast, PIP can react more freely, allowing the reaction to continue for a longer period.\n\n3. **Diffusion Rate**: The UV–vis spectrometer data indicates that PIP diffuses more easily through the membrane than PEI. This is likely due to the smaller size of PIP molecules, which allows them to penetrate the membrane more easily.\n\n4. **Polymerization Rate**: The difference in reaction rates between PEI and PIP affects the overall polymerization rate. PEI's slower reaction rate leads to a less uniform distribution of PEI within the membrane, while PIP's faster reaction rate results in a more uniform distribution.\n\n5. **Membrane Performance**: The differences in diffusion rate, reaction rate, and polymerization rate ultimately affect the performance of the membrane. The less uniform distribution of PEI can lead to a less stable and less selective membrane, while the more uniform distribution of PIP can result in a more stable and selective membrane.\n\nIn summary, the differences in molecular weight, reaction rate, diffusion rate, and polymerization rate between PEI and PIP lead to distinct membrane performances."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is that the different aqueous monomers PEI and PIP form membranes with different performance because of their differences in molecular weight, reaction rate, diffusion rate, and polymerization rate, which affect the uniformity and stability of the membrane."}], "response": "The answer is that the different aqueous monomers PEI and PIP form membranes with different performance because of their differences in molecular weight, reaction rate, diffusion rate, and polymerization rate, which affect the uniformity and stability of the membrane.", "confidence": [], "prediction": "that the different aqueous monomers PEI and PIP form membranes with different performance because of their differences in molecular weight, reaction rate, diffusion rate, and polymerization rate, which affect the uniformity and stability of the membrane.", "correct": false}

{"id": "test-00023", "question": "Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nRecent studies show that the surface morphology of a thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membrane depends strongly on its porous substrate. Nevertheless, the underlining mechanisms and the effects on membrane separation performance remain controversial. To dissect the exact role of pore properties, we synthesized TFC polyamide membranes on polycarbonate substrates with cylindrical track-etched pores (PCTE) of well-defined pore size ranging from 10 to 800 nm. Leaf-like roughness features were most prominent for polyamide films formed on substrates of intermediate pore sizes (80 and 100 nm).

For the PCTE substrates, increasing substrate pore size had an obvious positive effect in increasing the TFC membrane permeability (Figure 4A). However, the membrane rejection can be seriously comprised for cylindrical pores of greater than 100 nm in size (Figure 4B), possibly due to the greater tendency to form more defects in the polyamide layer over large substrate pores.19 In addition, for the ultrathin and unsupported polyamide film that spans over the large cylindrical pores of PCTE substrates, it is mechanically unstable (e.g., the thin film is stretched due to the tensile stress in the longitudinal direction when the membrane is pressurized, causing a loss of membrane integrity).

The polyamide nanofilm thickness is handily adjusted by the thickness of hydrophilic layers to tune the absorption of diamine solution within substrates (Fig. 2D to G and Fig. S6). The piperazine reserved within the Janus substrate declined from 228.7 to 25.4 nmol/cm2 with the same piperazine concentration of 34.8 mM when the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreased from 40.5 to 15.7 μm. Meanwhile, the nanofilm thickness is dramatically reduced from 88.4 to 3.8 nm as the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreases. It is worth noting the polyamide nanofilm with a thickness of 3.8 nm is one of the thinnest polyamide nanofilms as reported in the literature. This result demonstrates that Janus substrates provide an accessible, alternative, and novel “interfacial reactor” to effectively regulate the polyamide nanofilm thickness. Moreover, the hydrophobic layer can prevent the penetration of the aqueous solution into the substrate, especially for the large-pore substrates. The effect of the total piperazine amount on nanofilm morphology was observed by SEM. No polyamide nanofilm is formed on the nascent PPMM substrate because the diamine solution cannot be spread on the hydrophobic surface (Fig. S7).

The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane. These terminal groups significantly influence the  ionization behavior and electrical properties of polyamide, ultimately affecting the rejection of high-valence ions. Regrettably, these terminal groups were ignored in the calculation process of DNC, resulting in abnormal DNC values below 0% or exceeding 100%.

The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane. These terminal groups significantly influence the  ionization behavior and electrical properties of polyamide, ultimately affecting the rejection of high-valence ions. Regrettably, these terminal groups were ignored in the calculation process of DNC, resulting in abnormal DNC values below 0% or exceeding 100%. Moreover, the calculation of DNC usually relies on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, which employs the charge shift of the full spectrum, theoretical binding energy (BE), and peak fitting primarily based on the 1s peak of adventitious carbon. This approach, however, is not ideally compatible with carbon-based organic polymer materials with complex chemical environments, which further undermines the credibility of DNC as a reliable parameter for characterizing polyamide networks. On the one hand, the chemical environment of C in polyamide is complex, and the peaks in XPS are very wide. The highest position of C peak is usually the superposition of the peak positions of skeleton C and oxygencontaining C, which is difficult to confirm as the C 1 s BE commonly used for calibration (284.8-285.0 eV). On the other hand, XPS is difficult to avoid the interference of exogenous C, which has a wide range due to its poor electrical contact with the sample and will interfere with the peak shape of C. It is challenging to determine the extent to which the C 1 s spectrum is affected by the presence of adventitious carbon.

This hydrogelation process can lead to a denser membrane structure. A denser membrane has fewer pores and a higher resistance to solvent transport, which directly affects its permeability.\n\n4. **Permeance Decreases with Increasing Chitosan Content**: The text states that a consistent decrease in permeance was observed for all tested solvents as the chitosan content increased. This indicates that as more chitosan is incorporated into the membrane, the membrane becomes less permeable.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The permeability of the membrane decreases as the chitosan content increases.

It highlights a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection, indicating that higher HABD values are associated with better rejection performance.\n\n2. **Effect of Terminal Groups on HABD**: The analysis shows that the increase in terminal groups (carboxyl and amino groups) decreases the value of HABD but ensures it remains positive.

This indicates a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection. Likewise, a discernible trend of decreasing water permeance and NaCl permeability coefficient is visible with the increase of HABD (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10). Thanks to the comprehensive analysis of the polyamide structure, the calculated HABD consistently holds physical significance regardless of the proportion of terminal groups. The increase of terminal groups only decreases the value of HABD but will not cause it to become negative. This ensures that HABD can work for loose polyamides with rich terminal groups. Furthermore, HABD more accurately describes the correlations between crosslinked networks and performance. The closer the value of HABD is to 9.3 mmol g-1, the fewer carboxyl and amino groups are present in polyamide, indicating a higher conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization. Crosslinked polyamide membranes with higher HABD thus exhibit  reduced free volume and pore size resulting in higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance. Our analysis then extends to PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes. In this case, the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance becomes more challenging due to the contribution of both pore size and charge properties of polyamide membranes. A denser network provides a higher blocking ability to salt ions owing to the size exclusion effect, while the presence of abundant charge on the membrane surface can also block high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect. Most PIP-TMC polyamide membranes possess a substantial number of hydrolyzed TMC terminal structures and exhibit negative charges, exacerbating the difficulty to establish the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the structure of PIP-TMC polyamide to gain a better understanding of its nanofiltration behavior.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the question of how the presence of terminal carboxyl and amino groups affects the performance of polyamide membranes, let's break down the key points from the provided context:\n\n1. **HABD (Hydrolyzed Amide Bond Density) as a Performance Indicator**: The text introduces HABD as a measure of the crosslinked networks of polyamide membranes. It highlights a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection, indicating that higher HABD values are associated with better rejection performance.\n\n2. **Effect of Terminal Groups on HABD**: The analysis shows that the increase in terminal groups (carboxyl and amino groups) decreases the value of HABD but ensures it remains positive. This means that even with a higher number of terminal groups, the HABD value can still be meaningful for describing the performance of polyamide membranes.\n\n3. **Relationship Between HABD and Performance**: The text explains that a higher HABD value is associated with a higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance. This is because a higher HABD indicates a more dense crosslinked network, which results in reduced free volume and pore size. These characteristics lead to better salt rejection and lower water permeability.\n\n4. **Challenges with PIP-TMC Type Nanofiltration Membranes**: For PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes, the situation is more complex due to the contribution of both pore size and charge properties. The presence of hydrolyzed TMC terminal structures and negative charges complicates the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance.\n\n5. **Importance of Comprehensive Structure Analysis**: The text emphasizes the need for a comprehensive analysis of the polyamide structure to understand its nanofiltration behavior. This includes considering both the crosslinked network and the charge properties of the membrane.\n\nIn summary, the presence of terminal carboxyl and amino groups in polyamide membranes can affect their performance by influencing the HABD value, which in turn impacts the membrane's rejection and permeability characteristics. However, the impact of these groups is nuanced, and their effect is more pronounced in loose polyamides with rich terminal groups.

{"id": "test-00084", "question": "What was the optimal cross-linking temperature for the prepared loose NF membrane?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe chemistry property of the thin selective layer and its preparation condition had a decisive effect on separation performance of prepared composite NF membrane [37,38]. Firstly, the cross-linking temperature was studied at fixed concentration for gallic acid (0.1 wt%) and PEI (1 wt%) in coating solutions and cross-linking time of 30 min and the corresponding results were given in the Fig. 8. The permeate fluxes were sharply decreased from 50 L/m2·h to 10 L/m2·h (for Gongo red) and from 45 L/m2·h to 9.2 L/m2·h (for Methyl blue) while rejection ratios of Gongo red and Methyl blue increased slightly. This proved that skin layer formed by coating modified PEI became denser with increasing the temperature from 45 °C to 75 °C. Therefore, the cross-linking temperature was an important factor influening on  separation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane. Fig. 9(a) presented the effect of gallic acid concentration on the permeation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane at fixed 1 wt% PEI concentration in coating solution under TMP of 0.2 MPa and cross-linking temperature of 45 °C. For 0.1 wt% gallic acid, membrane permeate flux reached up to 51 L/m2· h. However, the further increasing gallic acid concentration from 0.1 wt% to 0.3 wt % would cause the decline in permeate flux, which was decresed from 51 L/m2·h to 29 L/m2·h. This could be explained by sheets polymers surface morphology (Fig. 7).

In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability.

In this study, the stability of the cLBL and  LBL-cPP NF membranes was tested under different treatment conditions. All the membranes showed a stable permeability and MgCl2 rejection after continuous operation of 50 h with DI water (Fig. A4(A)). Similarly, the permeability and MgCl2 rejection of the cLBL and LBLcPP membranes experienced little change after the treatment of an acidic solution at pH 4 (Fig. A4(B)), indicating good performance stability under acidic environment. However, a remarkable increase for permeability was observed for the cLBL membrane after alkaline treatment (Fig. 7). This demonstrated that the LBL layer was irreversibly swelled due to deionization of amine groups on the PAH polymer chains under strong alkaline condition [19]. Accordingly, the MgCl2 rejection of treated the cLBL membrane dropped by 20% after three alkaline treatment cycles.

This interaction was closely linked to the nondeformable fraction of hydrated ions. Further delineation of the dielectric effect showed that favorable interactions between ions and membrane functional groups contributed to entropy-driven selectivity, which is a key factor in explaining ion selectivity differences between ions sharing the same size and valence.

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time.

The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius. When tested using salt solution with a higher concentration 2000 ppm, the membrane still showed good rejection of MgCl2 and MgSO4, with a rejection rate of 94.1 and 91.5%, respectively.

As depicted in Fig. 10 (A), the EEM plots for feed solution were classified into four sections - I (humic-like substances; Ex > 280 nm, Em > 380 nm), II (protein-like substances; Ex = 250–280 nm, Em < 380 nm), III (fulvic acid-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em > 380 nm), and IV (tyrosine-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em = 330–380 nm) [51]. A distinct peak for tyrosine-like substances (IV) could be observed in feed solution, which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids. After the filtrations, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV) decreased by 84.2%, 89.3% and 93.9% for the permeates of the NF 270, cLBL and LBL-cPP membranes, respectively, compared to the feed solution, indicating better removal efficiency for tyrosine-like substances. In particular, the LBL-cPP membrane presented significant removal efficiency (decreased by 96.1%) for protein-like substances (II) from the feed solution, which was confirmed by its almost disappearing peak intensity (Fig. 10 (A)). Hence, the LBL-cPP membrane has a higher capacity to provide better permeate quality. It should be noted a small amount of fulvic acid-like substances (III) were identified in the permeate of all NF membranes. This is most likely due to their smaller molecular weights than the MWCOs of the NF membranes. Meanwhile, simpler organic compositions were illustrated by the foulant on the surface of the LBL-cPP membrane, which were composed of very small amounts of protein-like substances (II) and part of tyrosine-like substances (IV) that appeared far less than the amount on NF270 and cLBL (Fig. A5). These results were consistent with the flux profile of the LBLcPP membrane. Owing to the competitive hydrophilicity of the LBL-cPP membrane, most of the humic-like substances (I) and protein-like substances (II) did not adsorb onto the membrane surface.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To explain the improved RO (Reverse Osmosis) performance when using LBL-cPP (Layer-by-Layer Copolymer of Poly(allylamine) and Poly(4-styrenesulfonate)) as the feed, let's break down the key points from the provided context:\n\n1. **Superior Rejection**: The LBL-cPP membrane exhibits superior rejection of various contaminants, including TOC (Total Organic Carbon), Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+. This suggests that the membrane has a high affinity for these substances, preventing them from passing through.\n\n2. **Organic Composition in Permeate**: The EEM (Excitation-Emission Matrix) fluorescence spectra show that the permeate from the LBL-cPP membrane has a simpler organic composition compared to the feed solution. Specifically, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV), which are proteinaceous and associated with amino acids, decrease significantly (by 96.1%) in the LBL-cPP permeate, indicating a high removal efficiency for these substances.\n\n3. **Foulant Composition on the Membrane Surface**: The surface foulants on the LBL-cPP membrane are composed of very small amounts of protein-like substances (II) and part of tyrosine-like substances (IV), which are less abundant compared to those found on NF270 and cLBL membranes. This suggests that the LBL-cPP membrane has a lower propensity for adsorbing these substances onto its surface.\n\n4. **Competitive Hydrophilicity**: The competitive hydrophilicity of the LBL-cPP membrane is a key factor in its improved performance. Most of the humic-like substances (I) and protein-like substances (II) do not adsorb onto the membrane surface, which means they are not retained by the membrane and thus do not contribute to fouling or reduced permeate quality.\n\n5. **Flux Profile**: The flux profile of the LBL-cPP membrane is consistent with its fouling behavior, indicating that the membrane is less prone to fouling and maintains its permeability over time.\n\nIn summary, the improved RO performance of the LBL-cPP membrane can be attributed to its superior rejection of contaminants, simpler organic composition in the permeate, lower propensity for adsorbing foulants onto its surface, and competitive hydrophilicity.

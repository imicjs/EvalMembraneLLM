{"id": "test-00011", "question": "Is any additives used during membrane fabrication? If so, What role does it play in the synthesis of membranes?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nCharged functional groups are often incorporated onto the surface of nanofiltration (NF) membranes to facilitate the selective rejection of multivalent ions over monovalent ions. However, since fouling-resistant surfaces tend to be electrically neutral, the incorporation of charged functionality exacerbates membrane fouling. Multifunctional Janus membrane architectures, which incorporate chemically distinct domains over their cross section, provide a strategy for balancing the competing demands associated with making fouling-resistant, ion rejecting NF membranes. Here, through the controlled exposure of poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate-co-oligo-(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)) copolymer substrates to a series of reactive solutions containing alkyne-terminated molecules, the process for creating dual-functional membranes by using the copper(I)-catalyzed azide−alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction was analyzed. Under the appropriate conditions, the CuAAC reaction propagates into the copolymer substrate as a front. This phenomenon results in a process for creating layered domains of distinct functionality whereby the distribution of antifouling zwitterionic moieties and ion rejecting sulfonate moieties can be modified by manipulating the exposure time.

While the roughness features were barely noticeable for TFC-10, they became increasingly larger for TFC-30, TFC-50, and TFC-80. This trend can possibly be rationalized by the greater storage of MPD (Supporting Information S4) and its enhanced diffusion withincreasing pore size. According to the interfacial degassing theory, increasing the effective concentration of MPD would cause greater production of heat at the reaction interface to promote the release of CO2 nanobubbles. Our observation is also consistent with some earlier studies reporting increased roughness formation for larger pores.

The MD simulation results (Fig. 3d,e, Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) indicated that the initially formed polyamide oligomers at the n-decane–water interface spontaneously organized into a nanopore network. In our simulations (Supplementary Fig. 12), the nanopore size increased from approximately 13.4 nm to 29.3 nm as the number of diamine molecules decreased from 3,750 to 2,250, while maintaining a molar ratio of PIP to TMC of 3:2. This suggests that a nanopore size of around 30 nm can be achieved, aligning with the dimensions observed on both the back surface and the inner diameter of the nanotubes.

{"id": "test-00035", "question": "How should I use the monomer if I want to prepare a thin and uniform film?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe nanofiltration performance of our polyamide composite membranes was evaluated by a cross-flow filtration apparatus. The effects of diamine monomer amount and concentration on the membrane performance were investigated thoroughly (Fig. S11). The polyamide composite membranes fabricated by piperazine with a common concentration of 34.8 mM and limited total amount show both high water permeance and Na2SO4  rejection, which is superior to those membranes by the same total monomer amount but lower concentration, or the same concentration but higher total amount (Figs. S11 and S12). The differences in membrane performance stem from the structures of polyamide nanofilms formed under varying reaction conditions. A high concentration and limited amount of piperazine facilitate the formation of ultrathin and integral polyamide nanofilms. In contrast, both a high concentration and amount of piperazine yield dense but thick nanofilms, while a low concentration and limited amount of piperazine result in thin but defective nanofilms.

The impact of applied pressure on the water ux and Na2SO4 was rstly investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the water uxes improve  proportionally with increasing the pressure from 2 bar to 8 bar but tend to level off at higher pressures while the rejection of Na2SO4 reduced due to concentration polarization. More specically, TFC membranes synthesized by using PIP concentrations of 0.0175 wt% and 0.015 wt% have an ultrahigh water ux of 211.2 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 52.8 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) and 251.6 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) under 4 bar, respectively, while maintaining a satisfactorily high rejection of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4. Such a high permeability is expected to originate from the reduced thickness of the thin selective PA layer, improved negative charges, and defect-free thin PA layer resulting from the homogeneous interfacial polymerization at the perfect interface between hexane and the nanobrous hydrogel, which will be fully discussed in the following section. The desalination performance of these two hydrogel-TFC membranes was compared with other membranes reported in 28 top cited published papers in the last 3 years in Fig. 2b. The comparison graph suggests that the performance of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is, to a large extent, superior to all other membranes (Table S5†). Such a high performance has the potential to further reduce the energy demand of the current desalination process from the perspective of the membrane.4 It is also noted that the hydrogel based TFC membrane can even maintain a good Na2SO4 rejection under 8 bar although the brous hydrogel has a weak tensile strength of 0.185 0.021 MPa (Fig. S5†), which is mainly due to the strong interaction between the thin selective PA layer and the nanobrous hydrogel. The rejection of four salts (Na2SO4, MgSO4, MgCl2, and NaCl) was measured. The hydrogel-TFC membranes have a much higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 than MgCl2 and NaCl (Fig. 2c) due to the relatively larger size of the sulfate ions compared with the other three ions. Besides, hydrogel-TFC membranes are negatively charged which also contribute to the higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 due to the Donnan effect.

More specically, TFC membranes synthesized by using PIP concentrations of 0.0175 wt% and 0.015 wt% have an ultrahigh water ux of 211.2 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 52.8 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) and 251.6 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) under 4 bar, respectively, while maintaining a satisfactorily high rejection of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4. Such a high permeability is expected to originate from the reduced thickness of the thin selective PA layer, improved negative charges, and defect-free thin PA layer resulting from the homogeneous interfacial polymerization at the perfect interface between hexane and the nanobrous hydrogel, which will be fully discussed in the following section. The desalination performance of these two hydrogel-TFC membranes was compared with other membranes reported in 28 top cited published papers in the last 3 years in Fig. 2b. The comparison graph suggests that the performance of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is, to a large extent, superior to all other membranes (Table S5†). Such a high performance has the potential to further reduce the energy demand of the current desalination process from the perspective of the membrane.4 It is also noted that the hydrogel based TFC membrane can even maintain a good Na2SO4 rejection under 8 bar although the brous hydrogel has a weak tensile strength of 0.185 0.021 MPa (Fig. S5†), which is mainly due to the strong interaction between the thin selective PA layer and the nanobrous hydrogel.

This is expected because a more loosely crosslinked polyamide network with increased terminal groups provides larger voids and facilitates the transport of water molecules.

This observation can be explained by the presence of rich charges on the membrane surface, which blocks high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect as mentioned. To quantify terminal groups and analyze their ionization behavior, we have introduced two analogous parameters, namely the harmonic carboxyl density (HCD) and the harmonic amino density (HAD). These parameters, reflecting the contents of carboxyl and amino groups per mass of polyamide, are essential in accurately representing the surface charge of polyamides (Section 4 in Supplementary Information). It was demonstrated that PIP-TMC polyamide with higher HCD exhibits a stronger negative charge and higher Na2SO4 rejection (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).

{"id": "test-00086", "question": "How will the pure water permeation change if we increase the number of LBL layers? How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction. A systematic investigation of these parameters will be a focus in our future studies. Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1).

For example, the hydrated radius of Ca²⁺ (0.412 nm) is larger than that of Na⁺ (0.358 nm).\n   - NF membranes have a relatively small pore size, typically in the range of 0.5 to 2 nm. Larger hydrated divalent ions experience more steric hindrance and are less likely to pass through these pores compared to smaller monovalent ions.\n\n2. **Charge and Donnan Exclusion (DSPM-DE)**:\n   - NF membranes often have a negative charge due to the presence of carboxyl and sulfonic acid groups. This negative charge creates an electrostatic repulsion for anions and an attraction for cations.\n   - Divalent cations (e.g., Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺) have a stronger electrostatic interaction with the membrane charge than monovalent cations (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺). This stronger interaction enhances the rejection of divalent ions due to the increased electrostatic repulsion.\n   - For anions, divalent anions (e.g., SO₄²⁻) are more strongly repelled by the negatively charged membrane than monovalent anions (e.g., Cl⁻), leading to higher rejection.\n\n3. **Dielectric Exclusion (DSPM-DE)**:\n   - The dielectric exclusion effect arises from the difference in the dielectric constant between the membrane and the solution. Multivalent ions, due to their higher charge density, experience a stronger dielectric exclusion effect, further enhancing their rejection.\n\n4. **Solution-Diffusion Model**:\n   - According to this model, the solute permeability coefficient is lower for divalent ions due to their larger size and stronger interaction with the membrane material. This results in slower diffusion across the membrane and higher rejection.\n\nIn summary, divalent ions are more effectively rejected by NF membranes due to a combination of steric hindrance, stronger electrostatic interactions (Donnan exclusion), and dielectric exclusion.

As the film gets thicker, it becomes harder for the reactants to diffuse through it, which naturally limits the reaction rate.\n\n3. **MPD Availability**: The context also highlights the importance of the availability of MPD (meta-phenylenediamine). Earlier models and studies, such as those by Ukrainsky and Ramon, have shown that if MPD is continuously supplied, the IP process can continue, even though at a slower rate. This indicates that the self-limiting nature is not an intrinsic property of the film-formation process but can be influenced by external factors like the supply of reactants.\n\n4. **Experimental Evidence**: The fabrication of films with thicknesses on the order of tens of microns in a microfluidic channel, where MPD was continuously supplied, supports the idea that the IP process can proceed beyond typical self-limiting behavior under controlled conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the context, IP is not always self-limiting.

The improved thermal stability of the membranes fabricated using the cellulose–chitosan blends may be attributed to the entanglement of chitosan between the cellulose chains.

Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms.

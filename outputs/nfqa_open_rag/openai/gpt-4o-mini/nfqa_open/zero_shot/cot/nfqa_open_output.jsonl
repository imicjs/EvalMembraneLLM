The presence of darker regions in the images, as noted in your context, indicates the presence of nanoparticles (e.g., zeolite) within the polymer matrix. \n\n2. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**:\n   - Perform cross-sectional imaging to confirm that nanoparticles are not only present at the surface but also embedded within the bulk of the membrane. This can be done using focused ion beam (FIB) milling followed by SEM or TEM.\n\n3. **Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)**:\n   - Conduct EDX analysis in conjunction with SEM or TEM to identify the elemental composition of the membrane. The presence of elements specific to the nanoparticles (e.g., silicon or aluminum for zeolites) will confirm their incorporation.\n\n4. **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**:\n   - Use XRD to analyze the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles. The appearance of characteristic peaks corresponding to the nanoparticles in the diffraction pattern can confirm their presence in the membrane.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)**:\n   - Perform FTIR spectroscopy to identify any changes in the chemical bonding or functional groups in the membrane due to the incorporation of nanoparticles. New peaks or shifts in existing peaks can indicate successful integration.\n\n6. **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**:\n   - Conduct TGA to assess the thermal stability and composition of the membranes. The weight loss profile can provide insights into the amount of nanoparticles incorporated, as they may have different thermal properties compared to the polymer matrix.\n\n7. **Mechanical and Performance Testing**:\n   - Evaluate the mechanical properties and performance metrics (e.g., permeability, selectivity) of the membranes. Enhanced properties compared to pure TFC membranes can indicate successful nanoparticle incorporation.\n\n8. **Rheological Studies**:\n   - If applicable, perform rheological studies to understand the flow behavior of the polymer solution with nanoparticles. Changes in viscosity can indicate successful dispersion and incorporation of nanoparticles.\n\nBy following these steps, you can comprehensively confirm the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into TFC and TFN membranes.", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful membrane science assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: How to confirm the successful incorporation of nanoparticles?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nBoth TFC and TFN membranes exhibit nano-scale surface roughness, which is a well-known characteristic of interfacial polymerized polyamide RO membranes.

The presence of darker regions in the images, as noted in your context, indicates the presence of nanoparticles (e.g., zeolite) within the polymer matrix. \n\n2. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**:\n   - Perform cross-sectional imaging to confirm that nanoparticles are not only present at the surface but also embedded within the bulk of the membrane. This can be done using focused ion beam (FIB) milling followed by SEM or TEM.\n\n3. **Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)**:\n   - Conduct EDX analysis in conjunction with SEM or TEM to identify the elemental composition of the membrane. The presence of elements specific to the nanoparticles (e.g., silicon or aluminum for zeolites) will confirm their incorporation.\n\n4. **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**:\n   - Use XRD to analyze the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles. The appearance of characteristic peaks corresponding to the nanoparticles in the diffraction pattern can confirm their presence in the membrane.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)**:\n   - Perform FTIR spectroscopy to identify any changes in the chemical bonding or functional groups in the membrane due to the incorporation of nanoparticles. New peaks or shifts in existing peaks can indicate successful integration.\n\n6. **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**:\n   - Conduct TGA to assess the thermal stability and composition of the membranes. The weight loss profile can provide insights into the amount of nanoparticles incorporated, as they may have different thermal properties compared to the polymer matrix.\n\n7. **Mechanical and Performance Testing**:\n   - Evaluate the mechanical properties and performance metrics (e.g., permeability, selectivity) of the membranes. Enhanced properties compared to pure TFC membranes can indicate successful nanoparticle incorporation.\n\n8. **Rheological Studies**:\n   - If applicable, perform rheological studies to understand the flow behavior of the polymer solution with nanoparticles. Changes in viscosity can indicate successful dispersion and incorporation of nanoparticles.\n\nBy following these steps, you can comprehensively confirm the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into TFC and TFN membranes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To confirm the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into thin film composite (TFC) and thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Visual Inspection via Imaging Techniques**: Use Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to visualize the membrane morphology.

However, this huge O/N ratio difference is not observed on PIP/TMC membrane. This can be attributed to the significant molecular size difference between PIP and PEI. In a typical interfacial polymerization process, the small amine monomers (PIP) can easily pass through the nascent polyamide film into the organic phase to continuously react with TMC until a thick and dense polyamide layer is formed. However, the branched PEI with a molecular weight of 70000 Da is much larger than that of PIP (Mw = 86 Da), thus much more difficult to pass the nascent polyamide films to react with acyl chloride monomer (Fig. 2b and c). It is more likely that just part of the PEI branches pass the nascent polyamide film and join in the reaction, while  the other part of PEI was left in the aqueous phase side, resulting in an insufficient amine groups in organic phase. Consequently, many not fully reacted acyl chloride groups in TMC monomers finally hydrolyzed into carboxyl groups.

"prediction": "The Janus surface charge phenomenon in polyamide membranes is characterized by distinct differences in surface chemistry and charge between the front and rear surfaces of the membrane. This phenomenon arises from the interfacial polymerization process, where smaller amine monomers (like PIP) can easily diffuse through the nascent polyamide layer, leading to a more uniform and dense membrane structure. In contrast, larger branched amine monomers (like PEI) struggle to penetrate the nascent film, resulting in an uneven distribution of reactive groups.\n\nAs a result, the front surface of the PEI/TMC membrane exhibits a higher oxygen-to-nitrogen (O/N) ratio, indicating a greater concentration of oxygen-containing groups, which contributes to its hydrophilicity and potential negative charge. Conversely, the rear surface has a higher concentration of unreacted amine groups, leading to a more hydrophobic character and potential positive charge.\n\nThis Janus-like behavior, with one side being more hydrophilic and negatively charged and the other being more hydrophobic and positively charged, can significantly influence the membrane's filtration performance, including selectivity, permeability, and fouling resistance. Thus, the Janus surface charge phenomenon allows for tailored membrane properties that can enhance efficiency in various separation applications.", "correct": false}

(p-phenylenediamine) can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Molecular Size**: PEI has a larger molecular weight compared to PIP, which hinders its ability to diffuse through the nascent polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization process.\n\n2. **Diffusion Rates**: PIP exhibits a significantly greater diffusion rate into the organic phase, as indicated by the faster decrease in its concentration in the aqueous phase. This allows for a more effective reaction with TMC (trimesoyl chloride), leading to better incorporation into the membrane structure.\n\n3. **Reaction Kinetics**: The reaction between PEI and TMC stabilizes earlier than that of PIP and TMC, suggesting that PIP continues to react and contribute to membrane formation for a longer period. This extended reaction time can enhance the membrane's structural integrity.\n\n4. **Membrane Structure**: The differences in diffusion and reaction kinetics result in distinct microstructures for the membranes. PIP likely leads to a more interconnected and dense network, improving performance characteristics such as permeability and selectivity.\n\nIn summary, the combination of PEI's larger size, slower diffusion, and earlier stabilization of reaction compared to PIP results in membranes with different structural properties and performance outcomes. Membranes formed with PIP generally exhibit superior performance due to their more favorable structural characteristics.", "correct": false}

The PEI/TMC membrane demonstrated a great charge disparity between the two surfaces with a negatively charged (isoelectric point = 5.62) front surface and a positively charged (isoelectric point = 9.59) rear surface. As a result, the rear surface exhibits a higher MgCl2 rejection (95.6 %) than the front surface (88.9 %).

Multifunctional Janus membrane architectures, which incorporate chemically distinct domains over their cross section, provide a strategy for balancing the competing demands associated with making fouling-resistant, ion rejecting NF membranes.

Under the appropriate conditions, the CuAAC reaction propagates into the copolymer substrate as a front. This phenomenon results in a process for creating layered domains of distinct functionality whereby the distribution of antifouling zwitterionic moieties and ion rejecting sulfonate moieties can be modified by manipulating the exposure time. The ion rejection and fouling propensity for a family of dual-functional membranes was examined.

This result provides important insights into the surfactant-regulated IP mechanism.\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction_rationale": "To understand why it is unclear how adding surfactants to interfacial polymerization (IP) affects the nanostructure of the polyamide (PA) separation layer, we can break down the information provided in the context step by step:\n\n1. **Pristine PA Nanofilm Characteristics**: The pristine PA nanofilm has a specific thickness, surface features, density, and performance metrics (e.g., NaCl rejection and water permeance). This serves as a baseline for comparison when surfactants are added.\n\n2. **Surfactant Influence**: The addition of surfactants alters the structure and performance of the PA nanofilms. However, the effects depend on the charge characteristics of the surfactants used. This variability introduces complexity in predicting how surfactants will influence the nanostructure.\n\n3. **Diverse Effects of Different Surfactants**: For example, the anionic surfactant SDS caused significant changes in the film structure, leading to increased roughness and a multilayered porous structure. This indicates that different surfactants can have vastly different impacts on the nanostructure, making it difficult to generalize the effects of surfactants on IP.\n\n4. **Concentration-Dependent Changes**: The effects of surfactants are also concentration-dependent.

The structure and RO performance of the PA nanofilms were sensitively regulated by adding surfactants depending on the surfactant charge characteristics (Figure 1C−E). Meanwhile, regardless of the surfactant type, surfactant addition enabled the assembly of the ultrapermselective PA nanofilm with ∼2.4-fold higher water permeance and intact NaCl rejection compared to the pristine film, albeit at different optimum surfactant concentrations. The addition of anionic SDS led to the most significant change in film structure and performance, producing a highly rough and  multilayered porous PA structure (Figure 1C and Figures S4 and S7). Higher SDS concentrations progressively increased film surface roughness while producing a highly crumpled leaflike structure (up to 1 mM SDS), which turned into a discrete and aggregated structure at SDS > 1 mM. This morphological change was accompanied by a drastic increase in the structural hierarchy, apparent thickness, internal void fraction, and backside porosity of the PA nanofilm (Figures S4 and S7). Meanwhile, a noticeable reduction in its NaCl rejection but an increase in its water permeance were observed at SDS > 1 mM (Figure 1C), where discrete PA aggregates began to appear. The evolution of the defective aggregates at SDS > 1 mM was closely related to the significant reduction in PA density and thus NaCl rejection, as evidenced by its unmeasurably high MWCO (Figure S6). Notably, no enhancement in the molecular density and salt rejection of the PA nanofilm was observed upon the SDS addition (Figure S6). This result provides important insights into the surfactant-regulated IP mechanism.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To understand why it is unclear how adding surfactants to interfacial polymerization (IP) affects the nanostructure of the polyamide (PA) separation layer, we can break down the information provided in the context step by step:\n\n1. **Pristine PA Nanofilm Characteristics**: The pristine PA nanofilm has a specific thickness, surface features, density, and performance metrics (e.g., NaCl rejection and water permeance). This serves as a baseline for comparison when surfactants are added.\n\n2. **Surfactant Influence**: The addition of surfactants alters the structure and performance of the PA nanofilms. However, the effects depend on the charge characteristics of the surfactants used. This variability introduces complexity in predicting how surfactants will influence the nanostructure.\n\n3. **Diverse Effects of Different Surfactants**: For example, the anionic surfactant SDS caused significant changes in the film structure, leading to increased roughness and a multilayered porous structure. This indicates that different surfactants can have vastly different impacts on the nanostructure, making it difficult to generalize the effects of surfactants on IP.\n\n4. **Concentration-Dependent Changes**: The effects of surfactants are also concentration-dependent. For instance, increasing SDS concentrations led to progressive changes in surface roughness and structural hierarchy, but also resulted in a reduction in NaCl rejection at higher concentrations. This complexity means that the relationship between surfactant concentration and nanostructure is not straightforward.\n\n5. **Morphological Changes**: The transition from a highly rough structure to a discrete and aggregated structure at higher surfactant concentrations complicates the understanding of how surfactants influence the PA layer.

polymerization (IP) on the nanostructure of the polyamide (PA) separation layer stem from several factors:\n\n1. **Diverse Surfactant Effects**: Different surfactants can have vastly different impacts on the nanostructure due to their charge characteristics, making it difficult to generalize their effects.\n\n2. **Concentration-Dependent Changes**: The influence of surfactants is not linear; varying concentrations lead to different structural and performance outcomes. For example, higher concentrations of SDS resulted in significant morphological changes, including increased roughness and the formation of aggregates, which complicates the understanding of their impact.\n\n3. **Morphological Complexity**: The transition from a well-defined structure to a more complex, aggregated form at higher surfactant concentrations introduces variability that obscures the relationship between surfactant addition and nanostructure.\n\n4. **Performance Trade-offs**: The observed trade-offs, such as increased water permeance at the expense of NaCl rejection, indicate that the mechanisms by which surfactants influence the PA layer are complex and not fully understood.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Trends**: The lack of consistent trends in molecular density and salt rejection with surfactant addition further complicates the interpretation of how surfactants affect the IP process and the resulting nanostructure.\n\nIn summary, the interplay of these factors contributes to the uncertainty regarding how surfactants affect the nanostructure of the PA separation layer during interfacial polymerization.", "correct": false}

liquid along an interface caused by gradients in interfacial tension. In the context of interfacial polymerization (IP), this phenomenon occurs when the dissolution of a surfactant (such as TX-100) into a solvent (like n-hexane) creates a non-uniform concentration at the interface, leading to variations in interfacial tension. \n\nThis tension gradient drives liquid motion from areas of lower tension to areas of higher tension, resulting in convective interfacial flow known as solutal Marangoni convection. This flow can induce turbulence and instability at the interface, causing the nascent polymer layer (e.g., a polyamide layer) to crumple and promoting the migration of monomers (such as MPD) across the interface. \n\nAs a result, the continuous diffusion and reaction of monomers, coupled with the mechanical disturbances from Marangoni convection, lead to the formation of a rough, thick, and multi-layered porous nanofilm. This complex structure can significantly influence the membrane's performance in filtration or separation applications.", "correct": false}

This step forms a thin film of the dope solution on the support.\n\n4. **Phase Inversion**: \n   - Immediately after casting, the films are immersed in a 10-L water coagulation bath at 21 °C for phase inversion. This process lasts for more than 24 hours and is essential for solidifying the membrane structure by inducing phase separation, where the solvent is exchanged with water.\n\n5. **Removal of Residual Solvents**: \n   - After phase inversion, the membranes are transferred to another water bath (5 L) to ensure the complete removal of any residual solvents. This step is important for ensuring the purity and performance of the final membrane.\n\nBy following these steps, a range of cellulose and chitosan-based membranes can be fabricated, each with potentially different properties based on the composition of the dope solution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The method used to fabricate the membrane involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Preparation of Dope Solutions**: A total of 5 wt% cellulose and/or chitosan is dissolved in a cosolvent system of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Bmim][OAc]) at a 1:1 weight ratio.

sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Bmim][OAc]) at a 1:1 weight ratio. Different cellulose and chitosan ratios are used to create blends (90:10, 82:18, and 75:25 wt%), designated as M10/90, M18/82, and M25/75, respectively. A pristine cellulose membrane is also prepared as a reference (M5).\n\n2. **Mixing the Dope Solution**: The dope solution is mixed with an overhead stirrer at 80 rpm for 12 hours, followed by shaking at 350 rpm and 35 °C for another 12 hours to remove trapped air bubbles.\n\n3. **Casting the Membrane**: The prepared dope solution is cast onto a polypropylene (PP) nonwoven support using a casting knife (Elcometer 3700) with a gap of 250 μm and a casting speed of 0.04 m/s.\n\n4. **Phase Inversion**: The cast films are immediately immersed in a 10-L water coagulation bath at 21 °C for phase inversion, lasting more than 24 hours to solidify the membrane structure.\n\n5. **Removal of Residual Solvents**: The membranes are then transferred to a 5 L water bath to ensure the complete removal of any residual solvents.\n\nThis process results in the fabrication of cellulose and chitosan-based membranes with varying compositions and properties.", "correct": false}

surfactants like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and zwitterionic surfactants such as sulfobetaine 3-14 (SB 3-14) are ineffective in forming uniform pores because their charge interactions create repulsive forces with the polymer (PIP) used in the active layer. This repulsion increases the energy barrier for PIP diffusion across the interface, leading to slower and more heterogeneous transport of PIP. As a result, the pore size distribution becomes larger and more varied, rather than uniform, undermining the selectivity and performance of the active layer.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00023", "question": "Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nRecent studies show that the surface morphology of a thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membrane depends strongly on its porous substrate. Nevertheless, the underlining mechanisms and the effects on membrane separation performance remain controversial. To dissect the exact role of pore properties, we synthesized TFC polyamide membranes on polycarbonate substrates with cylindrical track-etched pores (PCTE) of well-defined pore size ranging from 10 to 800 nm. Leaf-like roughness features were most prominent for polyamide films formed on substrates of intermediate pore sizes (80 and 100 nm). Smaller pores inhibited leaf-like features as a result of insufficient storage of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) monomers for the interfacial reaction, whereas larger pores resulted in diminished surface roughness due to the lack of confinement to the interfacially degassed nanobubbles. Substrate porosity plays a critical role on membrane water permeability, while smaller pores with greater pore density are favored to improve membrane rejection. TFC polyamide membranes prepared on sponge-like poly(ether sulfone) and polysulfone substrates exhibit better water permeability and salt rejection compared to the PCTE-TFC membranes thanks to the simultaneously enhanced confinement and MPD storage effects.

Figure 1 presents the SEM micrographs of the PCTE substrates (top view) and the polyamide films (both top and bottom views). It is important to note that the actual pore size of PCTE-200 and PCTE-800 was approximately 70−90 nm larger than the respective nominal sizes provided by the manufacturer (Table 1). The nominal sizes of other PCTE substrates were reasonably accurate. The top surfaces of polyamide films show leaf-like roughness features whose presence was most obvious for TFC-80 and TFC-100. Increasing the substrate pore size from 100 to 800 nm led to the diminishing of these characteristic features. According to our recent works, the leaf-like features were formed due to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that are encapsulated between the polyamide film and the substrate. Increasing the pore size of the substrate would reduce the confinement effect by the substrate and allow the nanobubbles to escape through the large pores. In contrast to the common belief that leaves grow directly over pores, we observed smooth and flat polyamide films spanning over the pores of 80−200 nm (highlighted by the dotted circles in Figure 2). Indeed, the leaf-like features developed predominantly around the pores. Although these observations appear to be peculiar and counterintuitive, they are consistent with the interfacial degassing theory. Due to the release of heat and H+ during the IP reaction, the dissolved bicarbonate will be degassed (see ref 37 and Supporting Information S4). This degassing can possibly happen both inside the substrate pores and at the vicinity of the pores. The confinement effect by the solid matrix around the pores allows the CO2 nanobubbles to be retained, which shapes the leaf-like roughness features. However, the confinement effect was the weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, which prevents effective retention of degassed nanobubbles. Therefore, our study further confirms the critical importance of the substrate confinement effect in shaping the polyamide surface roughness. This confinement effect also explains why surface roughness could not effectively develop for polyamide films formed at free interfaces. With a further increase of substrate pore size to 800 nm, the polyamide intruded into the substrate due to a lack of effective support (see the bottom view of TFC-800 in Figure 1).", "label": ["The non-porous part of the base film is impermeable and has a stronger restriction effect on nanobubbles, forming a distinct leaf-like structure.

layer formed during the interfacial polymerization reaction. Specifically:\n\n1. **Smaller Pores (80-200 nm)**: When the substrate pore size is smaller, such as in the case of TFC-80 and TFC-100, the confinement effect is stronger. This allows CO2 nanobubbles to be retained between the polyamide film and the substrate, leading to the development of leaf-like roughness features on the membrane surface.\n\n2. **Larger Pores (up to 800 nm)**: As the substrate pore size increases, the confinement effect diminishes. This allows the CO2 nanobubbles to escape through the larger pores, resulting in a smoother and flatter polyamide film surface. The characteristic roughness features become less pronounced, as they primarily form around the pores rather than directly over them.\n\n3. **Excessively Large Pores**: If the pore size becomes too large (e.g., 800 nm), the polyamide may intrude into the substrate due to insufficient support, which can compromise the structural integrity of the membrane.\n\nIn conclusion, smaller substrate pore sizes promote the formation of roughness features due to enhanced confinement of gas bubbles, while larger pore sizes lead to smoother surfaces and potential structural issues in the membrane.", "correct": false}

This trend can be attributed to two main factors:\n     - **Increased MPD Storage**: Larger pores allow for greater storage of the monomer m-phenylenediamine (MPD). This increased storage leads to a higher effective concentration of MPD at the reaction interface during interfacial polymerization.\n     - **Enhanced Diffusion**: The larger pore size facilitates better diffusion of MPD, which can lead to more vigorous reactions at the interface, resulting in the production of heat and the release of CO2 nanobubbles.

the bottom membrane pore significantly affects the surface morphology of the final RO membrane separation layer formed during interfacial polymerization. In the range of 10-80 nm, increasing the pore size leads to greater roughness due to two main factors: \n\n1. **Increased MPD Storage and Diffusion**: Larger pores allow for greater storage of m-phenylenediamine (MPD), resulting in a higher effective concentration at the reaction interface. This enhances the diffusion of MPD, promoting more vigorous reactions and the production of heat, which facilitates the release of CO2 nanobubbles that contribute to surface roughness.\n\n2. **Competing Mechanisms**: While larger pores promote roughness through increased MPD storage and eruption, they also reduce the confinement effect, which can inhibit roughness formation. The interplay between these mechanisms results in increased roughness for pore sizes from 10 to 80 nm.\n\nIn contrast, in the range of 80-200 nm, the trend may reverse, leading to decreased roughness. This could be due to a shift in reaction dynamics that favors a more uniform polymerization process, resulting in a smoother surface. The larger pore sizes may also lead to less effective confinement, which alters the balance of the competing mechanisms, ultimately resulting in a reduction in surface roughness.\n\nIn summary, the increase in pore size from 10 to 80 nm promotes roughness due to enhanced MPD dynamics, while the behavior in the 80-200 nm range may lead to smoother surfaces due to different reaction dynamics and reduced confinement effects.", "correct": false}

Surface Porosity**: Sponge-like substrates, such as PES and PSf, have significantly higher surface porosity compared to cylindrical pore substrates like PCTE. This increased porosity correlates positively with membrane permeability, allowing for better fluid flow through the membrane.\n\n2. **Mechanical Stability**: The sponge-like structure offers better mechanical stability for the ultrathin polyamide films formed during interfacial polymerization. Unlike cylindrical pores, which can lead to stretching and loss of integrity under pressure, sponge-like pores help maintain the structural integrity of the membrane.\n\n3. **Reduced Defect Formation**: The irregular and interconnected nature of sponge-like pores reduces the tendency to form defects in the polyamide layer during polymerization. This leads to improved rejection performance and overall membrane quality.\n\n4. **Better Performance Balance**: PES and PSf substrates demonstrate a better balance of permeability and rejection compared to PCTE substrates, making them more effective for membrane applications.\n\nIn summary, the sponge-like pore structure enhances the performance and stability of TFC membranes, making these substrates more suitable for interfacial polymerization.", "correct": false}

steps:\n\n1. **Ultrasonic Wave Propagation**: Ultrasonic waves create alternating cycles of compression and rarefaction in a fluid.\n\n2. **Cavitation Bubble Formation**: During the rarefaction phase, if the pressure amplitude exceeds the tensile strength of the fluid, cavitation bubbles form.\n\n3. **Bubble Growth**: These bubbles grow during the low-pressure phase until they reach a certain size.\n\n4. **Bubble Collapse**: In the subsequent compression phase, the bubbles collapse violently when the pressure increases.\n\n5. **High-Energy Environment**: The collapse generates localized high temperatures and pressures, creating a high-energy acoustochemical environment that can facilitate various chemical reactions and physical processes.\n\nIn summary, ultrasonic cavitation is the process of bubble formation, growth, and collapse in a fluid due to ultrasonic wave propagation, resulting in a high-energy environment conducive to chemical and physical changes.", "correct": false}

of NoN (Nanotube-on-Nanotube) structures is affected by several key factors:\n\n1. **Support Membrane Material**: The type of support membrane (e.g., PVC, polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride) influences pore size, surface properties, and hydrophilicity, which affect the penetration of the piperazine solution.\n\n2. **Surface Hydrophilicity**: The hydrophilicity of the support membrane's surface is crucial for enhancing the absorption of the piperazine solution, leading to better reactant distribution during the interfacial reaction with trimesoyl chloride (TMC).\n\n3. **Air-Drying Time**: The duration the soaked membrane is left to dry at room temperature impacts the concentration of reactants within the membrane and the kinetics of the interfacial reaction, affecting the nanotube morphology.\n\n4. **Interfacial Reaction Control**: The interplay between interfacial reactions and capillary-driven self-organization must be carefully controlled to achieve closely packed and uniform nanotubes.\n\n5. **Organic Phase Selection**: The choice of organic solvent (e.g., n-decane, n-hexane, cyclohexane) during the interfacial reaction can influence solubility and reaction dynamics, affecting the resulting nanotube structure.\n\n6. **Reproducibility Across Conditions**: The ability to obtain similar NoN structures across various oil phases and support membranes indicates robustness in the synthesis process, allowing for reproducibility under different conditions.\n\nIn summary, optimizing these factors is essential for achieving the desired morphology and performance of NoN structures.", "correct": false}

Measure the water contact angle, which decreases below 50° with deposition times exceeding 1 hour, indicating increased hydrophilicity.\n\n4. **Absorption Capacity Measurement**:\n   - Assess the absorption capacity of the substrate for aqueous diamine solutions, which increases from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 6.57 ± 0.15 mg/cm² as the hydrophilic layer thickness increases.\n\n5. **Surface Morphology Assessment**:\n   - Examine the surface morphology post-deposition, confirming no significant changes after 4 hours, indicating that the PDA/PEI layer does not affect the substrate's permeance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Janus substrate is fabricated through a controlled co-deposition of PDA and PEI on a PPMM substrate, allowing for tunable hydrophilicity and absorption properties while maintaining the structural integrity and permeance of the original substrate."}], "response": "The fabrication process of the Janus substrate involves the following key materials and steps:\n\n### Key

involves the following key materials and steps:\n\n### Key Materials:\n1. **PPMM (Porous Polymeric Membrane Material)**: The base substrate for the Janus structure.\n2. **PDA (Polydopamine)**: A biopolymer used to create a hydrophilic layer.\n3. **PEI (Polyethyleneimine)**: A polymer that enhances the hydrophilicity of the PDA layer.\n\n### Fabrication Steps:\n1. **Substrate Preparation**: Begin with a clean PPMM substrate to ensure effective deposition.\n  \n2. **Single-sided Co-deposition**:\n   - Co-deposit PDA and PEI onto one side of the PPMM substrate.\n   - Control the deposition time (1 to 4 hours) to adjust the thickness of the hydrophilic layer, ranging from 2.9 to 40.5 μm.\n\n3. **Hydrophilicity Monitoring**:\n   - Measure the water contact angle, which decreases below 50° with deposition times exceeding 1 hour, indicating increased hydrophilicity.\n\n4. **Absorption Capacity Measurement**:\n   - Assess the absorption capacity of the substrate for aqueous diamine solutions, which increases from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 6.57 ± 0.15 mg/cm² as the hydrophilic layer thickness increases.\n\n5. **Surface Morphology Assessment**:\n   - Examine the surface morphology post-deposition, confirming no significant changes after 4 hours, indicating that the PDA/PEI layer does not affect the substrate's permeance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Janus substrate is fabricated through a controlled co-deposition of PDA and PEI on a PPMM substrate, allowing for tunable hydrophilicity and absorption properties while maintaining the structural integrity and permeance of the original substrate.", "correct": false}

The polyamide composite membranes fabricated by piperazine with a common concentration of 34.8 mM and limited total amount show both high water permeance and Na2SO4  rejection, which is superior to those membranes by the same total monomer amount but lower concentration, or the same concentration but higher total amount (Figs.

The hydrophilic side of the substrate absorbs a significant amount of piperazine, creating a high local concentration at the interface where polymerization occurs. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic side prevents the aqueous solution from penetrating into the substrate, maintaining this localized concentration and enhancing the efficiency of the reaction. Additionally, the thickness of the hydrophilic layer can be adjusted, allowing for precise control over the amount of piperazine absorbed and the resulting polyamide nanofilm thickness. This results in a critical amount of piperazine needed for effective film formation being significantly lower than that required on conventional hydrophilic substrates, demonstrating the Janus substrate's ability to regulate monomer usage effectively.", "correct": false}

{"id": "test-00041", "question": "Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nSince the groundbreaking introduction of bioinspired thin-film composite polyamide (PA) membranes for brackish water desalination and water purification nearly a decade ago, there have been only marginal advancements in enhancing the water permeance and water-salt selectivity specifically for seawater desalination. Herein, high-performance seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes were developed by integrating E. colibased or tannic acid (TA)-encapsulated liposomes, using either conventional blending or spray-assisted strategies with optimized nanovesicle utilization. The uniform nanovesicle dispersion on substrate surfaces and the regulated interfacial polymerization process significantly enhanced the membrane properties. Liposomeintegrated membranes, such as the BM-Conv and BM-Spray membranes prepared via conventional blending and spray-assisted pre-deposition strategies, respectively, exhibited enlarged nanovoid size and increased rear surface porosity beneath the protuberant PA layer. These changes, along with an enlarged surface area, improved wettability, and reduced cross-linking degree, resulted in a notable 47.1–58.8 % improvement in water permeance, reaching 2.5–2.7 L m 2 h 1 bar 1, while exhibiting a slight reduction in salt rejection (99.05–99.13 %) compared to the nanovesicles-free control membrane. Notably, the feasible spray-assisted technique achieved comparable separation performance while using just 3.8 % of the liposome quantity required in the conventional blending approach, significantly reducing additive consumption.

What role did PIP play in the polyamide network formation?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. The MWCO of the polyamide composite ceramic membranes was tested with PEGs and diethylene glycol, and both of the membranes PA100 and PA-200 had a similar MWCO of 240–260 Da, as shown in Fig. 9. The membrane MWCO was smaller than most of the PEI-based polyamide membranes on hollow fibre or tubular membrane substrates [19,29,43]. Pure PEI-based polyamide membranes usually have MWCO between 350 and 500 Da and the addition of PIP in this study has shown effective in reducing the MWCO of the membranes without reducing the flux significantly. The PEG rejection of PA-200 was slightly lower than PA-100, which could be due to minor defects in the polyamide layer. The membrane PA-100 was also tested for sugar and dye rejections. The rejections of raffinose (504 g/mol), sucrose (342 g/mol) and glucose (180 g/mol) were 99.1, 98.9 and 87.4%, respectively, and the rejections of rose bagel (875 g/mol), acid fuschin (586 g/mol) and methyl orange (327 g/mol) were 99.2, 99.9 and 99.0%, respectively.

However, fouling of low-pressure NF membranes restricts their application in providing high quality feed to subsequent RO process. In this study, an antifouling low-pressure NF membrane was designed and fabricated via rapid co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI) on electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled polyethersulfone (PES) flat sheet membrane followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The optimized resultant membrane (LBL-cPP) presented approximately 11 LMH/bar pure water permeability with more than 90% rejection divalent cations under 2 bar pressure. The newly developed selective layer exhibited excellent antifouling performance and chemical stability ascribing to the inherent hydrophilicity of PDA/PEI and dual covalent reaction of PDA with the LBL layer. By feeding real municipal wastewater, the LBL-cPP membrane also achieved superior permeate quality, leading to lower RO fouling rate in subsequent RO unit as compared to commercial NF 270 membrane. Further organic foulant analysis indicated that 96.8% of dissolved organic carbons were effectively removed by the LBL-cPP membrane. Specifically, the novel NF membrane demonstrated high removal rate (> 93%) for foulants with low molecular weights which was largely responsible for RO fouling, while maintaining the desired flux recovery rate and reduced cleaning frequency.

through the principles of double layer theory, but the relationship is semi-quantitative and can be influenced by factors such as ion adsorption. Zeta potential is a measure of the electrokinetic potential at the plane of shear and can be directly measured, making it more commonly reported in literature. However, it does not directly reflect the fixed charge density of the membrane, which can lead to misleading conclusions about the membrane's charge characteristics. For mechanistic studies, quantifying surface charge density is more useful, as it provides clearer insights into how charge affects processes like salt transport. In contrast, zeta potential can be used for semi-quantitative analyses, such as determining the iso-electric point or assessing the effects of surface modifications.", "correct": false}

Highlight their applications and limitations.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThree types of microscopic techniques are commonly used to characterize the morphology of TFC-PA membranes: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). When performing high-resolution SEM, a conductive coating, for instance, gold or palladium, is used to improve membrane visibility to provide direct visualization of the surface (top view) and cross-sectional morphology. For example, TFC-PA membranes made using MPD amine monomers for SWRO were observed to have a ridge-and-valley morphology for the PA layer. By contrast, membranes fabricated using PIP amine monomers for NF typically have nodular morphology. Other interesting morphologies, such as stripes, craters and 2D fractals, can also emerge with interfacial polymerization processes that are modified with additives or post-treatment. Usually, TEM is used to image membrane cross-sections to evaluate PA layer thickness and to identify voids in the PA layer by distinguishing different parts — PA layer, polysulfone or polyethersulfone support, and voids — on the basis of their different electron transmittance values. Staining the PA layer with heavy metals increases the electron contrast between the PA layer and polysulfone or polyethersulfone support, enabling the interface to be more clearly discerned68.

Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for Characterizing TFC-PA Membranes**\n\n### Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\n**Applications:**\n- SEM is used to analyze the surface morphology of TFC-PA membranes, providing a top-down view that reveals structural features such as ridges, valleys, and nodular formations.\n- It is effective in studying the effects of different fabrication methods and additives on membrane morphology.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- High-resolution imaging of surface features, which is crucial for understanding how morphology affects membrane performance.\n- Relatively straightforward sample preparation, although a conductive coating is often required.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Primarily provides surface information and does not effectively reveal internal structures or layer thickness.\n- The need for a conductive coating can alter the surface characteristics, potentially affecting results.\n- Limited depth of field may hinder visualization of features at varying heights.\n\n### Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\n\n**Applications:**\n- TEM is utilized to examine the internal structure and cross-sectional morphology of TFC-PA membranes, allowing for the evaluation of polyamide layer thickness and identification of voids.\n- Techniques like heavy metal staining and elemental mapping via EDS in STEM enhance contrast and provide detailed insights into layer composition.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Offers high-resolution images that reveal fine details of internal structures, including layer thickness and defects.\n- The ability to perform elemental mapping allows for comprehensive analysis of material distribution within the membrane.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Requires extensive sample preparation, including ultra-thin sectioning, which can be challenging and may alter the sample.\n- More complex and time-consuming than SEM, requiring specialized equipment and expertise.\n- Less effective for imaging large areas compared to SEM, as it typically focuses on smaller regions of interest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, SEM is advantageous for surface morphology analysis of TFC-PA membranes, providing quick and high-resolution images of surface features, while TEM excels in characterizing internal morphology and layer thickness. Both techniques are complementary and can provide valuable insights into the structure and performance of TFC-PA membranes when used together.", "correct": false}

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how the Marangoni effect influences membrane morphology:\n\n1. **Interfacial Turbulent Flow**: The Marangoni effect is driven by gradients in surface tension, which can create interfacial turbulent flow. This flow can lead to instability at the interface where the membrane is forming.\n\n2. **Crumpling of the PA Layer**: As the interfacial turbulent flow induced by Marangoni instability occurs, it can cause the nascent PA layer to crumple.

The continuous MPD diffusion-reaction coupled with successive film crumpling likely resulted in a rough, thick, and multi-layered porous PA nanofilm. Although the heat released from the exothermic IP reaction  possibly drives Rayleigh−Benárd instability, this thermallydriven instability may not dominate the Marangoni effect due to the small Rayleigh number.16 Interfacial degassing may partially contribute to the interfacial instability, but its effect may also not be strong in our case.

This flow can lead to instability at the interface where the membrane is forming.\n\n2. **Crumpling of the PA Layer**: As the interfacial turbulent flow induced by Marangoni instability occurs, it can cause the nascent PA layer to crumple.

nascent polyamide (PA) layer. This crumpling facilitates the trans-interface migration of monomers, such as MPD (m-phenylenediamine), promoting continuous diffusion and reaction at the interface. As a result, the membrane develops a rough, thick, and multi-layered porous structure. While other instabilities, like Rayleigh-Bénard instability, may be present, the Marangoni effect predominates due to the small Rayleigh number. Additionally, interfacial degassing has a limited impact since generated nanobubbles can be effectively eliminated during the formation of the PA nanofilms. Overall, the Marangoni effect plays a crucial role in shaping the final morphology of the membrane.", "correct": false}

"prediction": "The surface roughness can be further decreased by electrospraying a Span 80 interlayer before electrosprayed interfacial polymerization due to the flexibility of Span 80 molecules, which contain a long aliphatic tail (16 carbon atoms). This flexibility allows the Span 80 to spread and fill in surface irregularities on the PES membrane, effectively smoothing the surface. As a result, the RSa value decreases from 9.7 nm to 6.5 nm, indicating a significant reduction in surface roughness. The smoother surface provided by the Span 80 interlayer also facilitates a more uniform polymer layer during the subsequent interfacial polymerization, further enhancing the membrane's overall smoothness.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00054", "question": "How was the uniformity of positive charge distribution quantified?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nTo localize the distribution of positive charges on the fabricated NF membrane surface, the Orange II dye with negative charges as a tracer molecule was employed to interact electrostatically one-to-one with positively charged amino groups on the membrane surface in an acidic condition (pH = 3) [29]. The sulfur atoms (S) in the Orange II dye were used as tracer atoms. The sample preparation for EDS determination on FETEM was shown in Scheme 2. Briefly, the NF membrane was firstly immersed into 0.5 mmol/L Orange II dye aqueous solution (pH = 3) for full complex of amino groups with positive charge on the surface of obtained NF membranes with the negatively charged Orange II dye under stirring for 6 h at 25 ℃. Subsequently, the membrane surface was rinsed and sonicated repeatedly at least 3 times with 1 mmol/L HCl to remove the unabsorbed dye thoroughly. In order to characterize the positive charge distribution as accurately as possible, the support of NF membrane was completely dissolved and cleaned by DMAc to obtain an independent PA separation layer with a thickness thin than 200 nm. Then, the PA layer can be penetrated by electron beams of TEM with a 200 kV accelerating voltage to improve the resolution of EDS mapping. Finally, it was loaded and dried on a copper grid to be characterized by EDS. The K-nearest neighbor method was employed to quantify the density and uniformity of element distribution points (S, or N atoms) in EDS mapping images. For any target point, K-nearest neighbor points to the target point were found; and the average distance between these neighbor points and the target point was counted. The above steps were repeated for all S element points in the mapping image. The total average distance and the standard deviation of the average distance were calculated. The total average distance, corresponding to the total points per unit area, can characterize the density of the S element points. The standard deviation of the average distances can reflect the degree of uniformity of element point distribution.

The sulfur atoms (S) in the Orange II dye were used as tracer atoms. The sample preparation for EDS determination on FETEM was shown in Scheme 2. Briefly, the NF membrane was firstly immersed into 0.5 mmol/L Orange II dye aqueous solution (pH = 3) for full complex of amino groups with positive charge on the surface of obtained NF membranes with the negatively charged Orange II dye under stirring for 6 h at 25 ℃. Subsequently, the membrane surface was rinsed and sonicated repeatedly at least 3 times with 1 mmol/L HCl to remove the unabsorbed dye thoroughly. In order to characterize the positive charge distribution as accurately as possible, the support of NF membrane was completely dissolved and cleaned by DMAc to obtain an independent PA separation layer with a thickness thin than 200 nm. Then, the PA layer can be penetrated by electron beams of TEM with a 200 kV accelerating voltage to improve the resolution of EDS mapping. Finally, it was loaded and dried on a copper grid to be characterized by EDS. The K-nearest neighbor method was employed to quantify the density and uniformity of element distribution points (S, or N atoms) in EDS mapping images. For any target point, K-nearest neighbor points to the target point were found; and the average distance between these neighbor points and the target point was counted.

The total average distance provided a measure of the density of S element points, while the standard deviation of these average distances indicated the degree of uniformity in the distribution of the positive charges.\n\nThus, the total average distance characterizes the density of the positive charge distribution, and the standard deviation reflects its uniformity.

The lateral cross-sectional morphology shown in Fig. 2i indicates that the central lumens of nanotubes are connected to the porous substrate, allowing for the determination of the inner diameter and wall thickness of the nanotubes. Specifically, the inner diameter is ~30 nm, and the wall thickness is ~60 nm, which is slightly thinner than the thickness of the nanofilm underneath  (~80 nm). These data regarding the inner diameter and wall thickness exhibited a high degree of consistency with the previously presented nanotube outer diameter data (Fig. 2b).

The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane. These terminal groups significantly influence the  ionization behavior and electrical properties of polyamide, ultimately affecting the rejection of high-valence ions. Regrettably, these terminal groups were ignored in the calculation process of DNC, resulting in abnormal DNC values below 0% or exceeding 100%. Moreover, the calculation of DNC usually relies on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, which employs the charge shift of the full spectrum, theoretical binding energy (BE), and peak fitting primarily based on the 1s peak of adventitious carbon. This approach, however, is not ideally compatible with carbon-based organic polymer materials with complex chemical environments, which further undermines the credibility of DNC as a reliable parameter for characterizing polyamide networks. On the one hand, the chemical environment of C in polyamide is complex, and the peaks in XPS are very wide. The highest position of C peak is usually the superposition of the peak positions of skeleton C and oxygencontaining C, which is difficult to confirm as the C 1 s BE commonly used for calibration (284.8-285.0 eV). On the other hand, XPS is difficult to avoid the interference of exogenous C, which has a wide range due to its poor electrical contact with the sample and will interfere with the peak shape of C. It is challenging to determine the extent to which the C 1 s spectrum is affected by the presence of adventitious carbon. Therefore, conducting charge shift with C is likely to result in the peak of N and O not appearing in the theoretical BE.

parameter in characterizing polyamide membranes is its inability to accurately account for the significant influence of terminal groups introduced by modern interface polymerization methods. These terminal groups affect the membrane's ionization behavior and electrical properties, which in turn impact water permeance and salt rejection. Additionally, the reliance on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for DNC calculations is problematic due to the complex chemical environment of carbon in polyamide and the interference from adventitious carbon, leading to inaccurate and unreliable DNC values.", "correct": false}

{"id": "test-00062", "question": "Which characterization technique provided direct evidence of nanochannels around AgNPs in TFN membranes?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe desalination performance of the nanobrous hydrogel assisted TFC nanoltration membranes (PIP 0.0175 wt% and PIP 0.0150 wt%; TMC 0.1 w/v%) was evaluated using 1000 ppm Na2SO4 in a cross-ow at membrane ltration apparatus. The impact of applied pressure on the water ux and Na2SO4 was rstly investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the water uxes improve  proportionally with increasing the pressure from 2 bar to 8 bar but tend to level off at higher pressures while the rejection of Na2SO4 reduced due to concentration polarization. More specically, TFC membranes synthesized by using PIP concentrations of 0.0175 wt% and 0.015 wt% have an ultrahigh water ux of 211.2 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 52.8 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) and 251.6 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) under 4 bar, respectively, while maintaining a satisfactorily high rejection of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4. Such a high permeability is expected to originate from the reduced thickness of the thin selective PA layer, improved negative charges, and defect-free thin PA layer resulting from the homogeneous interfacial polymerization at the perfect interface between hexane and the nanobrous hydrogel, which will be fully discussed in the following section. The desalination performance of these two hydrogel-TFC membranes was compared with other membranes reported in 28 top cited published papers in the last 3 years in Fig. 2b. The comparison graph suggests that the performance of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is, to a large extent, superior to all other membranes (Table S5†). Such a high performance has the potential to further reduce the energy demand of the current desalination process from the perspective of the membrane.4 It is also noted that the hydrogel based TFC membrane can even maintain a good Na2SO4 rejection under 8 bar although the brous hydrogel has a weak tensile strength of 0.185 0.021 MPa (Fig. S5†), which is mainly due to the strong interaction between the thin selective PA layer and the nanobrous hydrogel. The rejection of four salts (Na2SO4, MgSO4, MgCl2, and NaCl) was measured. The hydrogel-TFC membranes have a much higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 than MgCl2 and NaCl (Fig. 2c) due to the relatively larger size of the sulfate ions compared with the other three ions. Besides, hydrogel-TFC membranes are negatively charged which also contribute to the higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 due to the Donnan effect.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to calculate the diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the free water and in the nanobrous hydrogel (Fig. 4a and b). The diffusion coefficients of the PIP molecules can be estimated from the slope of the mean square displacement (MSD) curves in Fig. 4c by the Einstein relationship.35 The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in water (6.0 10 10 m2 s 1) agrees well with the experimental results (6.07 10 10 m2 s 1 at 1.46 mol L 1, 298.15 K) in aqueous solution, which conrms the accuracy of our MD simulations. The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel is 4.3 10 10 m2 s 1, 28.3% lower than that in the water, conrming our hypothesis in the explanation of the ultrahigh water permeability of hydrogel-TFC membranes in the previous section. The relatively low PIP diffusion rate in the nanobrous Kevlar hydrogel is mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar networks; this also affects the interfacial polymerization. Therefore, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations were carried out to investigate the interfacial polymerization on the nanobrous hydrogel. The snapshots of the initial simulation system before the interfacial polymerization process, as well as the equilibrium state of the system aer the interfacial polymerization process are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, PIP monomers are well dispersed in water and the hydrogel before interfacial polymerization. Aer a simulation of 500 000 steps to reach the equilibrium state of the system, all the PIP monomers moved to the interface of free n-hexane and free water in the free water/n-hexane system (Fig. 5b). In contrast, there were still many PIP monomers left in the hydrogel without moving to the interface in the Kevlar hydrogel/ n-hexane system (Fig. 5d), indicating a lower diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel. More specically, the PIP monomers remaining in the hydrogel preferentially attached on the Kevlar molecules, which conrmed the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar network. In addition, compared to the thin selective layer in Fig. 5b, the active layer formed in the hydrogel system is thought to be thinner than that in the water system, due to the strong interaction between PIP and the Kevlar network.", "label": ["MD simulations quantified a 28.3% reduction in PIP diffusion rate in the hydrogel compared to water, attributed to hydrogen bonding with Kevlar chains."], "prompt": "Q: Describe how MD simulations supported the experimental findings on PIP monomer diffusion in the hydrogel.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nMultiscale simulations were conducted to study the diffusion of PIP monomers in the nanofibrous Kevlar hydrogel and the process interfacial polymerization on the nanofibrous hydrogel  (simulation details can be found in the ESI in Section 3†).

The relatively low PIP diffusion rate in the nanobrous Kevlar hydrogel is mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar networks; this also affects the interfacial polymerization. Therefore, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations were carried out to investigate the interfacial polymerization on the nanobrous hydrogel. The snapshots of the initial simulation system before the interfacial polymerization process, as well as the equilibrium state of the system aer the interfacial polymerization process are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, PIP monomers are well dispersed in water and the hydrogel before interfacial polymerization. Aer a simulation of 500 000 steps to reach the equilibrium state of the system, all the PIP monomers moved to the interface of free n-hexane and free water in the free water/n-hexane system (Fig. 5b). In contrast, there were still many PIP monomers left in the hydrogel without moving to the interface in the Kevlar hydrogel/ n-hexane system (Fig. 5d), indicating a lower diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel. More specically, the PIP monomers remaining in the hydrogel preferentially attached on the Kevlar molecules, which conrmed the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar network.

findings on PIP monomer diffusion in the hydrogel by providing quantitative diffusion coefficients that closely matched experimental results. Specifically, the diffusion rate of PIP monomers in water was calculated to be \\(6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\), which aligned well with the experimental value of \\(6.07 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\). In the Kevlar hydrogel, the diffusion rate was found to be \\(4.3 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\), indicating a 28.3% reduction compared to water. This reduction was attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar network, which hindered their mobility and confirmed the hypothesis regarding the hydrogel's ultrahigh water permeability. Additionally, DPD simulations illustrated that PIP monomers remained in the hydrogel during interfacial polymerization, further supporting the conclusion that the hydrogel structure significantly affects PIP diffusion and polymerization behavior. Overall, the MD simulations provided critical insights that validated and explained the experimental observations.", "correct": false}

pore size that is too large, allowing PTP molecules to pass through easily.\n\n2. **Charge Interactions**: If PTP has a similar charge to the membrane surface, there may be reduced electrostatic repulsion, leading to lower rejection rates.\n\n3. **Molecular Size and Shape**: The size and shape of PTP may enable it to navigate through the membrane pores more effectively.\n\n4. **Membrane Fouling**: Accumulation of particles or solutes on the membrane surface can alter its effective pore size and decrease rejection performance.\n\n5. **Operating Conditions**: High pressures or specific temperature conditions may enhance the permeation of PTP through the membrane.\n\n6. **Chemical Compatibility**: Favorable interactions between PTP and the membrane material can lead to increased permeation.\n\n7. **Membrane Aging**: Degradation or changes in the membrane structure over time can negatively impact its rejection capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the combination of these factors

membranes compared to Thin Film Composite (TFC) membranes include:\n\n1. **Smoother Surface**: TFN membranes generally have smoother surfaces, which reduces fouling and enhances water flow.\n\n2. **Increased Hydrophilicity**: TFN membranes exhibit lower contact angles (around 40° compared to 70° for pure polyamide), indicating greater hydrophilicity, which improves water permeability.\n\n3. **Enhanced Negative Charge**: TFN membranes are more negatively charged, which can improve salt rejection and reduce the attraction of negatively charged contaminants, leading to better performance in water purification.\n\n4. **Better Water Permeability**: The combination of smoother surfaces and increased hydrophilicity results in higher water permeability for TFN membranes.\n\n5. **Improved Fouling Resistance**: The hydrophilic and smooth characteristics of TFN membranes contribute to better resistance to fouling, reducing maintenance needs and operational costs.\n\nOverall, TFN

The roughness of TS-I and TS-II is measured at 22 nm and 32 nm, respectively.

higher water flux in membranes exhibiting Turing structures is primarily due to their increased surface roughness and heterogeneous nature, which create more pathways for water transport. Specifically, the striped Turing structure (TS-II) has a significantly larger surface area compared to the spotted structure (TS-I), allowing for more efficient water permeation. This larger surface area, combined with the unique nanoscale features of the Turing structures, reduces resistance to flow and enhances the overall permeability of the membrane compared to traditional smooth membranes.", "correct": false}

{"id": "test-00071", "question": "What does the following context mainly explain?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nOur results show a clear inverse correlation between the parameters; that is, salt permeability is reduced with the increase in |ζ|, which implies that ZP is a reasonable indicator for Donnan exclusion. For instance, at pH 4.0 and I = 1 mM, the |ζ| is relatively low due to weak membrane charge with the accompanying reduced Donnan effects, which results in relatively high ion permeability (Fig. 4b). At pH 7.5 and high ionic strength, the |ζ| is greater and consequently ion permeability is reduced. The main reason for the lower permeability under these conditions is schematically explained in Fig. 4c, showing higher membrane charge, which is partly neutralized by the ions. At pH 7.5 and low ionic strength (Fig. 4d), there is limited charge screening, therefore many membrane charges generate strong Donnan effects resulting in very low permeability. The ZP results may also imply subtle differences in Donnan exclusion experienced by Li+ and Cs+, as reflected by the good correlation between the ratios of LiCl and CsCl ζ (rζ 1⁄4 ζLiCl=ζCsCl) and Ps (rP 1⁄4 PsðLiClÞ=PsðCsClÞ). Notably, the largest rζ was obtained at pH 7.5 and 1 mM, where the negative membrane charge is high (Fig. 1a, c) and charge screening is minor (Fig. 4d), leading to noticeable differences in Cs+ and Li+ permeabilities (rP = 0.74). It is stressed that we tested the match between ZP and Donnan exclusion only for pH ≤ 7.5, where the fixed membrane charge is solely influenced by protonation of carboxyl groups (Eq. (1)), while the amine groups are positively charged throughout the pH range. Thus, in the tested conditions, ZP is directly related to the overall number of charged fixed groups. On the other hand, at pH > 7.5, the increase in |ζ| with pH is the outcome of the protonation of  charged amine groups (i.e., Eq. (2)), resulting in a decrease in overall number of charged groups, but an increase in the overall negative charge. Lastly, we considered the potential effect of the carbonate system and water ions on the pH near the membrane wall. Based on the pKa values, the concentrations of the various species (Supplementary Table 3), and the expected permeability of the species, we computed the potential effect on the pH (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 2).

Furthermore, HABD more accurately describes the correlations between crosslinked networks and performance. The closer the value of HABD is to 9.3 mmol g-1, the fewer carboxyl and amino groups are present in polyamide, indicating a higher conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization. Crosslinked polyamide membranes with higher HABD thus exhibit  reduced free volume and pore size resulting in higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance.

ways:\n\n1. **Decreased HABD**: An increase in terminal groups leads to a lower Hydrophilic Amine Bond Density (HABD), which indicates a higher proportion of terminal groups and a lower conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization.\n\n2. **Improved NaCl Rejection**: Higher HABD values (fewer terminal groups) correlate with improved NaCl rejection due to a denser crosslinked network that enhances the membrane's ability to block salt ions.\n\n3. **Reduced Water Permeance**: As HABD increases, there is a trend of decreasing water permeance and NaCl permeability coefficient, meaning that membranes with higher HABD are less permeable to both water and salt ions.\n\n4. **Smaller Pore Size and Reduced Free Volume**: Higher HABD results in reduced free volume and smaller pore sizes, contributing to better salt rejection.\n\n5. **Complexity in Nanofiltration**: In PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes, the presence of terminal groups complicates the correlation between the crosslinked network and performance due to the influence of charge properties and the Donnan effect.\n\nIn summary, terminal carboxyl and amino groups significantly influence the performance of polyamide membranes by affecting their structural characteristics, which in turn impacts salt rejection, water permeance, and overall filtration behavior. Higher densities of amide bonds (fewer terminal groups) generally lead to better performance in terms of salt rejection but lower water permeance.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00081", "question": "What structural parameter is used in HABD calculation to account for carboxyl and amino groups? How does the MgCl2 rejection change as the carboxyl density increase?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs the amide bond density decreases and the number of terminal groups increases in the crosslinked network, PIP-TMC polyamide membrane exhibits higher water permeance. This is expected because a more loosely crosslinked polyamide network with increased terminal groups provides larger voids and facilitates the transport of water molecules. However, the change in Na2SO4 rejection is not significantly affected by the variation in HABD. This observation can be explained by the presence of rich charges on the membrane surface, which blocks high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect as mentioned. To quantify terminal groups and analyze their ionization behavior, we have introduced two analogous parameters, namely the harmonic carboxyl density (HCD) and the harmonic amino density (HAD). These parameters, reflecting the contents of carboxyl and amino groups per mass of polyamide, are essential in accurately representing the surface charge of polyamides (Section 4 in Supplementary Information). It was demonstrated that PIP-TMC polyamide with higher HCD exhibits a stronger negative charge and higher Na2SO4 rejection (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). This finding strongly supports the notion that incorporating strong negative charges is effective in rejecting divalent anions when designing nanofiltration membranes. Nonetheless, the rejection of nanofiltration membranes is contributed by two factors: the screening of pores brought by polyamide networks and the Donnan effect of surface charge. Therefore, it is challenging to establish reliable structure-activity relationships by isolating these two factors. We recommend the comprehensive use of our proposed structural parameters − HABD and HCD. Our method offers a possibility to comprehensively analyze the rejection of nanofiltration, by providing information on HABD for the compactness of crosslinked polyamide networks, as well as HCD and HAD for the charge density of the polyamide nanofilms.

Interestingly,  the rejection to Na2SO4 (>95.6%) is much higher than that to NaCl (<34.0%) owing to the stronger electrostatic repulsion  and the larger hydrated ion radius of SO2−  4 (0.38 nm) in contrast  to Cl− (0.33 nm) [45], demonstrating excellent separation ratio between monovalent and divalent ions. The NaCl/Na2SO4 selectivity reaches 21.0 and 23.6 for the composite membranes with nanofilms of 3.8 and 5.8 nm (Fig. 4C).

(such as chloride, Cl−). The negatively charged surface creates strong electrostatic repulsion against negatively charged divalent anions, leading to higher rejection rates (e.g., over 95% for Na2SO4) compared to much lower rejection rates for NaCl (less than 34%). Additionally, the larger hydrated radius of sulfate ions (0.38 nm) compared to chloride ions (0.33 nm) further contributes to this selective rejection. Overall, the surface charge facilitates excellent separation between monovalent and divalent ions, resulting in high selectivity and effective performance of the membranes in nanofiltration applications.", "correct": false}

Firstly, the cross-linking temperature was studied at fixed concentration for gallic acid (0.1 wt%) and PEI (1 wt%) in coating solutions and cross-linking time of 30 min and the corresponding results were given in the Fig. 8. The permeate fluxes were sharply decreased from 50 L/m2·h to 10 L/m2·h (for Gongo red) and from 45 L/m2·h to 9.2 L/m2·h (for Methyl blue) while rejection ratios of Gongo red and Methyl blue increased slightly.

Therefore, the cross-linking temperature was an important factor influening on  separation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane.

Fig. 6a and b shows the moduli of the membranes measured across the scan area. The patterns look different compared to the topography images shown in the previous section (Fig. 3b and d). Especially for PA200, the area with high moduli is very distinct from the area with low moduli. The mean moduli obtained were 5.11 and 3.95 GPa for membrane PA-100 and PA-200, respectively, and these values were higher than the modulus of commercial polyamide nylon [39]. The moduli were also higher than that measured using the wrinkling-cracking method, where one of the highest modulus values measured was only 2.71 GPa [16]. The high moduli measured in this study could be contributed by the ceramic substrates underneath the polyamide layer, and further analysis on the measured data was required to determine the real modulus of the polyamide layer. The PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. As ceramic substrates have high chemical and thermal stabilities, polyamide-ceramic composite membranes could be potentially useful for more challenging applications such as organic solvent or high temperature nanofiltration.

Fig. 6a and b shows the moduli of the membranes measured across the scan area. The patterns look different compared to the topography images shown in the previous section (Fig. 3b and d). Especially for PA200, the area with high moduli is very distinct from the area with low moduli. The mean moduli obtained were 5.11 and 3.95 GPa for membrane PA-100 and PA-200, respectively, and these values were higher than the modulus of commercial polyamide nylon [39]. The moduli were also higher than that measured using the wrinkling-cracking method, where one of the highest modulus values measured was only 2.71 GPa [16]. The high moduli measured in this study could be contributed by the ceramic substrates underneath the polyamide layer, and further analysis on the measured data was required to determine the real modulus of the polyamide layer. The PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. As ceramic substrates have high chemical and thermal stabilities, polyamide-ceramic composite membranes could be potentially useful for more challenging applications such as organic solvent or high temperature nanofiltration.

{"id": "test-00086", "question": "How will the pure water permeation change if we increase the number of LBL layers? How about shorten crosslinking time?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction. A systematic investigation of these parameters will be a focus in our future studies. Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)). As already been attested by previously study, such an observation suggested that the Donnan exclusion theory played a major role [17]. On the other hand, the salt rejection test suggested that the LBL-cPP NF membrane reached the 90% rejection for divalent  cations and about 20% rejection for monovalent cations, while maintaining the order of MgCl2 > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 > NaCl. This result was reasonable for positively charged NF membrane and corroborated the benefits of a relatively dense selectivity layer brought about by the co-deposition of PDA/PEI. Therefore, it can be concluded that similar results on MgSO4 rejection between the NF 270 and LBL-cPP membranes were due to different dominant rejection mechanisms.", "label": ["Decrease if we increase the number of LBL layers.

A shorter crosslinking time may result in a less dense and less tightly packed selective layer, allowing for greater water flow.

Understanding how the LBL-cPP membrane performs under these conditions is crucial for its practical application. The study highlights that the chemical stability of the membrane is vital, especially since the non-covalent components of the membrane can be unstable under harsh conditions.\n\n2. **Covalent and Non-Covalent Interactions**: The LBL-cPP membrane is designed using a combination of covalent polymerization and non-covalent self-assembly. While covalent bonds provide stability, the non-covalent interactions can be susceptible to degradation. Testing the membrane's performance helps to evaluate how well these interactions hold up under different treatment conditions.\n\n3. **Crosslinking Effects**: The study indicates that increasing the crosslinked structure in the coating layer enhances stability. By testing the membrane, researchers can assess how effective the CuSO4/H2O2-triggered PDA/PEI codeposition process is in creating covalent bonds and crosslinked sites that contribute to the overall stability of the membrane.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics**: The stability tests measure key performance indicators such as permeability and MgCl2 rejection. The results show that the LBL-cPP membrane maintains stable performance under various conditions, which is critical for its reliability in real-world applications.\n\n5. **Response to Environmental Changes**: The study reveals that the cLBL membrane experiences significant changes in permeability and rejection rates under alkaline conditions, while the LBL-cPP membrane shows negligible changes. This indicates that the LBL-cPP membrane is more resilient to environmental changes, which is an important factor for its long-term use.\n\n6. **Practical Implications**: Understanding the performance stability of the LBL-cPP membrane under different conditions informs its potential applications in water treatment and other filtration processes. It helps in predicting the membrane's lifespan and efficiency, which are crucial for industrial applications.\n\nIn summary, testing the performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membranes is vital to ensure their reliability, effectiveness, and longevity in practical applications, particularly in environments that require regular chemical cleaning and exposure to varying pH levels.", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful membrane science assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: Why test the performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membrane?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe chemical stability of membrane plays a crucial role in practical applications due to the need for regular chemical cleaning.

Accordingly, the MgCl2 rejection of treated the cLBL membrane dropped by 20% after three alkaline treatment cycles. In contrast, the rejection loss was negligible for the LBL-cPP membrane, which was due to the covalent crosslinking of PDA/PEI on the LBL layer.\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Testing the performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membranes is essential for several reasons:\n\n1. **Chemical Stability**: Membranes are often subjected to harsh cleaning conditions, including chemical treatments. Understanding how the LBL-cPP membrane performs under these conditions is crucial for its practical application. The study highlights that the chemical stability of the membrane is vital, especially since the non-covalent components of the membrane can be unstable under harsh conditions.\n\n2. **Covalent and Non-Covalent Interactions**: The LBL-cPP membrane is designed using a combination of covalent polymerization and non-covalent self-assembly. While covalent bonds provide stability, the non-covalent interactions can be susceptible to degradation. Testing the membrane's performance helps to evaluate how well these interactions hold up under different treatment conditions.\n\n3. **Crosslinking Effects**: The study indicates that increasing the crosslinked structure in the coating layer enhances stability. By testing the membrane, researchers can assess how effective the CuSO4/H2O2-triggered PDA/PEI codeposition process is in creating covalent bonds and crosslinked sites that contribute to the overall stability of the membrane.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics**: The stability tests measure key performance indicators such as permeability and MgCl2 rejection. The results show that the LBL-cPP membrane maintains stable performance under various conditions, which is critical for its reliability in real-world applications.\n\n5. **Response to Environmental Changes**: The study reveals that the cLBL membrane experiences significant changes in permeability and rejection rates under alkaline conditions, while the LBL-cPP membrane shows negligible changes. This indicates that the LBL-cPP membrane is more resilient to environmental changes, which is an important factor for its long-term use.\n\n6. **Practical Implications**: Understanding the performance stability of the LBL-cPP membrane under different conditions informs its potential applications in water treatment and other filtration processes. It helps in predicting the membrane's lifespan and efficiency, which are crucial for industrial applications.\n\nIn summary, testing the performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membranes is vital to ensure their reliability, effectiveness, and longevity in practical applications, particularly in environments that require regular chemical cleaning and exposure to varying pH levels."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membranes is tested to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in practical applications, particularly under harsh cleaning conditions and varying environmental factors.

The addition of AgNPs can influence the membrane's surface properties, potentially increasing its hydrophilicity. A more hydrophilic surface can lead to reduced membrane fouling and improved water permeability.\n\n2. **Hydrophilicity**: The presence of AgNPs may enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. Increased hydrophilicity can lead to higher water flux because water molecules can more easily permeate through the membrane. This is particularly important in membrane processes, where water flux is often limited by the interaction between water and the membrane surface.\n\n3. **Fouling Resistance**: AgNPs are known for their antimicrobial properties, which can help reduce biofouling on the membrane surface. Reduced fouling can maintain higher water flux over time, as fouling typically leads to increased resistance to flow and decreased permeate quality.\n\n4. **Pore Size and Distribution**: If the addition of AgNPs alters the pore size or distribution within the membrane, this could also affect water flux.

membrane with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is likely to be higher than that of a membrane without AgNP addition. This is due to several factors:\n\n1. **Increased Hydrophilicity**: The addition of AgNPs can enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface, allowing for better water permeation.\n\n2. **Reduced Fouling**: AgNPs possess antimicrobial properties, which can help minimize biofouling on the membrane surface, maintaining higher water flux over time.\n\n3. **Optimized Pore Structure**: The presence of AgNPs may influence the pore size and distribution, potentially facilitating higher water flow while still effectively rejecting contaminants.\n\nOverall, these factors suggest that the TFN membrane with AgNPs would exhibit improved water flux compared to a membrane without AgNPs. However, experimental validation would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00089", "question": "What are the improvements in the rejection of small organic molecules by membranes prepared by hydrogel-assisted interfacial polymerization?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nWith the rapid growth of the world population and water contamination, nanofiltration membranes with extraordinary permeance and high salt rejection are eminently desirable for addressing global water scarcity. Here, an innovative approach to design thin film composite (TFC) membranes with ultrahigh permeance via hydrogel assisted interfacial polymerization is reported. The hydrogel containing piperazine (PIP) monomers serving as an aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization enable homogeneous interfacial polymerization, reducing the diffusion rate of the PIP monomers, and providing mechanical strength to the thin polyamide (PA) selective layer.

uniform distribution of piperazine (PIP) monomers, leading to a more consistent polyamide (PA) selective layer.\n\n2. **Controlled Diffusion Rate**: The hydrogel reduces the diffusion rate of PIP monomers, resulting in a denser and more selective membrane that enhances the rejection of small organic molecules.\n\n3. **Increased Mechanical Strength**: The hydrogel provides mechanical strength to the thin film composite (TFC) membranes, allowing them to withstand operational pressures and maintain integrity during filtration.\n\n4. **High Permeance with High Rejection Rates**: The membranes achieve ultrahigh permeances (52.8 and 62.9 L m² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) while maintaining high rejection rates for sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) (96.4% and 93.5%), indicating effective filtration capabilities.\n\n5. **Superior Desalination Performance**: These membranes demonstrate better desalination performance compared to traditional polyamide TFC nanofiltration membranes.\n\n6. **Cost-efficient and Scalable

The nanobrous hydrogel was prepared via phase inversion by immersing the Kevlar/DMSO dope solution (2 wt%, Fig. S1†) in a water bath. The obtained Kevlar hydrogel is transparent and so (Fig. 1a), comprising three-dimensional (3D) nanobrous networks (Fig. 1c and S2†) and is signicantly different from conventional polymeric membranes (Fig. S3†) in morphology and structure. Besides, the nanobrous hydrogel has a water content of 96.5 wt% which is much higher than the conventional support membrane. Such a high water uptake makes it similar to the free water phase in synthesizing a freestanding PA membrane. Therefore, the hydrogel can be applied as the aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization to enable a homogeneous polymerization. To introduce PIP monomers into the nanobrous hydrogel, PIP monomers was dissolved in the water bath which is used for the phase inversion (Fig. S6a and b†). In this case, the PIP monomers are preloaded in the nanobrous hydrogel during its formation. Then, the interfacial polymerization was initiated by pouring trimesoyl chloride (TMC)/hexane solution on the porous bottom surface (Fig. S2c†) rather than the dense top surface (Fig. S2d†) of the PIP preloaded hydrogel (Fig. 1b). Aer interfacial polymerization, crosslinked and defect-free PA selective nanolayers with a thickness down to 15.5 nm (Fig. 1d) were obtained. The hydrophilic (Fig. S7,† water contact angle: 54 ) selective PA layer is rmly attached to, even fused to, the surface of the nanobrous hydrogel (Fig. 1e), indicating a robust interaction between the selective layer and the nanobrous hydrogel, and thus the relatively high stability of the TFC membranes. This tight integration of the PA selective layer and the Kevlar hydrogel is mainly due to the high compatibility between these two polymers resulting from the presence of the same chemical groups and their similar chemical composition (Fig. 1f). In addition, the surface of the hydrogel-TFC membrane is entirely smooth with a nanoscale roughness of nearly 8 nm (Fig. 1g). This feature differs from other reported highly permeable membranes with rough crumpled structures or Turning structures, probably endowing the resulting membranes with a lower fouling during desalination compared with these rough membranes. Most importantly, unlike conventional interfacial polymerization involving two stepwise solution immersion processes, only one simple TMC solution immersion was applied to initiate the interfacial polymerization because PIP monomers were preloaded in the hydrogel.

"The hydrogel-TFC membrane achieves higher permeability compared to conventional PA membranes due to several key factors:\n\n1. **High Water Content**: The Kevlar hydrogel substrate has a water content of 96.5 wt%, which enhances water transport and permeability.\n\n2. **Three-Dimensional Nanofibrous Network**: The unique 3D nanofibrous structure of the hydrogel increases porosity, facilitating better water flow.\n\n3. **Homogeneous Polymerization**: The hydrogel allows for a more uniform interfacial polymerization process, resulting in fewer defects in the PA layer and improved water flux.\n\n4. **Thin Selective Layer**: The PA layer is very thin (down to 15.5 nm), which reduces resistance to water flow and increases permeability.\n\n5. **Robust Interaction and Stability**: Strong chemical compatibility between the PA layer and the hydrogel substrate ensures stability, maintaining high permeability over time.\n\n6. **Smooth Surface with Low Roughness**: The smooth surface (nanoscale roughness of ~8 nm) minimizes fouling, which can impede water flow.\n\n7. **Simplified Synthesis Process**: The modified interfacial polymerization process, involving only one immersion step, enhances control over membrane properties and production efficiency.\n\nOverall, these factors collectively contribute to the hydrogel-TFC membrane's superior permeability compared to conventional PA membranes.", "correct": false}

"prediction": "Therefore, the increase in feed temperature is likely to decrease the rejection of salt ions by the VNF2 membrane. This is due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Increased Pore Size**: As the temperature rises, the pore size of the VNF2 membrane increases, which may allow more salt ions to pass through, especially if the ions are close to the size of the pores.\n\n2. **Higher Water Permeability**: The pure water permeability of the membrane increases with temperature, leading to higher water flux. This increased flux can dilute the concentration of salt ions in the permeate, potentially reducing the effective rejection rates.\n\n3. **Decreased Viscosity**: The reduction in water viscosity at higher temperatures can enhance the permeation of water, further influencing the dynamics of ion rejection.\n\nIn summary, while higher temperatures improve water flux and permeability, they may compromise the membrane's ability to reject salt ions effectively, leading to lower rejection rates.", "correct": false}

The charge of the membrane influences how ions interact with it. Higher ion concentrations can lead to increased electrostatic interactions between the ions and the membrane surface.\n\n2. **Donnan Effect**: The presence of ions in the feed water can create a Donnan equilibrium, where the distribution of ions across the membrane is influenced by the charge of the membrane. This can lead to a concentration polarization effect, where the concentration of ions near the membrane surface differs from that in the bulk solution, potentially affecting permeability.\n\n3. **Viscosity and Flow**: Higher ion concentrations can increase the viscosity of the solution, which may affect the flow rate through the membrane. Increased viscosity can lead to reduced water permeability, as the energy required to push water through the membrane increases.\n\n4. **Membrane Fouling**: High ion concentrations can contribute to membrane fouling, where particles and ions accumulate on the membrane surface, leading to reduced permeability. This is particularly relevant in applications like textile and pulp and paper industries, where the presence of organic and inorganic substances can exacerbate fouling.\n\n5. **Temperature Effects**: As mentioned in the context, NF membranes are used in high-temperature applications. Higher temperatures can increase the kinetic energy of water molecules, potentially enhancing permeability. However, the effect of temperature may interact with ion concentration, as higher temperatures can also affect the solubility and behavior of ions in solution.\n\n6. **Ion Size and Charge**: The size and charge of the ions present in the solution also play a crucial role. Smaller ions or those with higher charge densities may be more easily rejected by the membrane, while larger or neutral ions may pass through more readily.

through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Electrostatic Interactions**: Higher ion concentrations can enhance electrostatic interactions between the ions and the charged membrane surface, potentially influencing permeability.\n\n2. **Donnan Effect**: The presence of ions can create a Donnan equilibrium, leading to concentration polarization at the membrane surface, which may reduce water permeability.\n\n3. **Viscosity Changes**: Increased ion concentration can raise the viscosity of the solution, making it more difficult for water to flow through the membrane, thereby decreasing permeability.\n\n4. **Membrane Fouling**: High ion concentrations can contribute to fouling, where ions and particles accumulate on the membrane surface, leading to reduced permeability over time.\n\n5. **Ion Characteristics**: The size and charge of the ions also play a role; smaller or highly charged ions may be more effectively rejected, affecting the overall water flux.\n\n6. **Temperature Effects**: In high-temperature applications, while increased temperature can enhance permeability, the interaction with ion concentration can complicate this effect.\n\nIn summary, higher ion concentrations can lead to reduced water permeability in NF membranes due to increased fouling, viscosity, and altered electrostatic interactions, among other factors.", "correct": false}

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Understanding Dielectric Constant**: The dielectric constant is a measure of a solvent's ability to reduce the electrostatic forces between charged particles (like ions). In bulk water, this value is relatively high (εb = 78.4 at 25 ℃), which facilitates the solvation of ions, allowing them to move freely.\n\n2. **Confined Pores and Reduced Dielectric Constant**: In NF membranes, the pores are often very narrow. When ions enter these confined spaces, the dielectric constant can drop significantly compared to its bulk value. This reduction occurs because the structure of the confined space limits the ability of water molecules to orient themselves around the ions effectively.\n\n3. **Solvation Energy Barrier**: The decrease in the dielectric constant leads to an increase in the solvation energy barrier for ions. Essentially, ions require more energy to be solvated (surrounded by solvent molecules) in these narrow pores than they would in bulk water. This increased energy requirement acts as a barrier to ion transport.\n\n4. **Hindrance to Ion Transport**: As a result of the solvation energy barrier, the movement of ions through the NF membrane is hindered.

nanofiltration (NF) membranes by reducing the dielectric constant in the confined narrow pores compared to its bulk value. This reduction creates a solvation energy barrier for ions, making it more difficult for them to be solvated and transported through the membrane. As a result, ion movement is hindered, leading to decreased ion flux and selectivity, which can impact the overall performance of the membrane in applications such as water treatment and desalination.", "correct": false}

The solution-diffusion model is convenient because it enables the transport characteristics of a TFC-PA membrane to be described with two parameters: the water permeability coefficient and the solute permeability coefficient.

The higher charge of divalent ions leads to stronger electrostatic interactions with the charged membrane surface.\n   - Additionally, divalent ions are typically larger in size compared to monovalent ions. The combination of size and charge affects how these ions interact with the membrane.\n\n2. **Donnan Exclusion**: \n   - The DSPM-DE model incorporates the concept of Donnan exclusion, which states that charged solutes are repelled by the charged membrane surface. Since divalent ions have a higher charge density, they experience a stronger repulsive force from the membrane compared to monovalent ions. This results in a higher rejection rate for divalent ions.\n\n3. **Steric Exclusion**: \n   - The pore size of NF membranes is typically designed to allow the passage of smaller, neutral solutes while rejecting larger or charged species. Divalent ions, being larger and more highly charged, are more likely to be sterically hindered from passing through the membrane pores compared to smaller monovalent ions.\n\n4. **Dielectric Exclusion**: \n   - The DSPM-DE model also considers dielectric exclusion, which suggests that ions with higher charge densities (like divalent ions) are less likely to penetrate the membrane due to the electric field created by the membrane's charge.

Repulsion**: Divalent ions carry a +2 charge, which leads to stronger electrostatic interactions with the charged membrane surface compared to monovalent ions, which carry only a +1 charge. This increased repulsion enhances the rejection of divalent ions.\n\n2. **Steric Exclusion**: Divalent ions are generally larger than monovalent ions. The pore size of NF membranes is designed to allow smaller solutes to pass while rejecting larger or more highly charged species. As a result, divalent ions are more likely to be sterically hindered from passing through the membrane pores.\n\n3. **Dielectric Exclusion**: The presence of a charged membrane creates an electric field that affects ion transport. Divalent ions, with their higher charge density, are less likely to penetrate the membrane due to this dielectric exclusion effect.\n\n4. **Lower Effective Diffusion Rates**: In the solution-diffusion model, divalent ions may have lower effective diffusion coefficients compared to monovalent ions, leading to reduced permeation rates for divalent ions.\n\nOverall, these factors contribute to the higher rejection efficiency of NF membranes for divalent ions compared to monovalent ions.", "correct": false}

The activator is localized at specific sites where it comes into contact with the inhibitor (trimesoyl chloride, TMC). This localized activation occurs because the activator reacts quickly with the inhibitor at the interface of the two immiscible phases (aqueous and organic).

following key points:\n\n1. **Local Activation**: The activator (piperazine, PZ) initiates polymerization at specific sites where it comes into contact with the inhibitor (trimesoyl chloride, TMC). This reaction occurs predominantly at the interface of the two immiscible phases, leading to localized activation of the polymerization process.\n\n2. **Lateral Inhibition**: Once the activator has reacted in a localized area, it inhibits the activation of neighboring regions due to the presence of the inhibitor, which diffuses into adjacent areas. This creates a pattern where activated regions are surrounded by inhibited ones, preventing further polymerization in those areas.\n\n3. **Diffusion Coefficients**: The differences in diffusion rates between the activator and inhibitor are crucial. The slower diffusion of the activator, especially when influenced by increased viscosity from additives like PVA, allows for localized activation while the inhibitor spreads out, enhancing the lateral inhibition effect.\n\n4. **Synergetic Effects**: The combination of physical obstruction in the nanosized pores and the chemical interaction with macromolecules increases the viscosity of the activator solution, further slowing its diffusion. This creates the necessary conditions for Turing patterns to emerge.\n\n5. **Pattern Formation**: The interplay between local activation and lateral inhibition leads to a diffusion-driven instability, resulting in the formation of nanoscale spotted and striped structures characteristic of Turing patterns.\n\nIn summary, the \"local activation and lateral inhibition\" mechanism facilitates the emergence of Turing structures through a dynamic balance of localized polymerization and inhibition, driven by the differences in diffusion rates and the effects of viscosity in the system.", "correct": false}

In the context of ion transport, it influences how ions interact with their surrounding environment, particularly in terms of solvation and energy barriers.\n\n2. **Ion Entry into Nanopores**: When an ion approaches a nanopore, it must transition from the bulk solution (where the dielectric constant is typically higher) into the pore (which may have a lower dielectric constant). This transition is crucial because the dielectric constant affects the solvation energy of the ion.\n\n3. **Solvation Energy Barrier**: As the ion enters the nanopore, it encounters a solvation energy barrier due to the difference in dielectric constants. In a medium with a lower dielectric constant, the ion is less effectively solvated, meaning it experiences a higher energy barrier to enter the pore. This is because the attractive forces between the ion and the solvent molecules are weaker in the lower dielectric environment.\n\n4. **Dielectric Exclusion**: The phenomenon where the difference in dielectric constant hinders ion transport is referred to as dielectric exclusion. This effect is particularly significant in nanofiltration (NF) processes and is closely related to the size of the pore. Smaller pores may exacerbate this effect, as the ion must fit through a confined space where the dielectric properties are markedly different from the bulk solution.\n\n5. **Ion Cavity Radius vs. Stokes Radius**: Recent studies suggest that using the ion cavity radius (the effective size of the ion when considering its solvation shell) rather than the Stokes radius (which is based on the hydrodynamic size of the ion) provides a more accurate representation of the dielectric exclusion effect. This is because the ion cavity radius better accounts for the actual interaction of the ion with the surrounding medium as it enters the pore.\n\n6. **Quantification of Dielectric Exclusion**: By employing the ion cavity radius in calculations, researchers can more precisely quantify the extent of dielectric exclusion and its impact on ion transport.

constant between the bulk solution and the membrane pore significantly affects ion transport by creating a solvation energy barrier that ions must overcome to enter the pore. This phenomenon, known as dielectric exclusion, arises because the lower dielectric constant within the pore reduces the effectiveness of solvation, making it more difficult for the ion to transition from the bulk solution to the pore. \n\nAs a result, ions experience increased resistance to transport due to this energy barrier, which is particularly pronounced in smaller nanopores. Recent studies suggest that using the ion cavity radius, rather than the Stokes radius, provides a more accurate measure for quantifying dielectric exclusion, leading to better predictions of ion behavior in membrane processes. Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing ion transport in applications such as nanofiltration and membrane technology.", "correct": false}

Unfortunately, coupled with complex natural instability phenomena, the IP mechanism and key parameters underlying the structural evolution of nanofilms, especially in the presence of surfactants as an interface regulator, remain puzzling. Here, we interfacially assembled polymer nanofilm membranes at the free water−oil interface in the presence of differently charged surfactants and comprehensively characterized their structure and properties. Combined with computational simulations, an in situ visualization of interfacial film formation discovered the critical role of Marangoni instability induced by the surfactants via various mechanisms in structurally regulating the nanofilms. Despite their different instability-triggering mechanisms, the delicate control of the surfactants enabled the fabrication of defect-free, ultra-permselective nanofilm membranes. Our study identifies critical IP parameters that allow us to rationally design nanofilms, coatings, and membranes for target applications.", "label": ["Autonomous Interfacial Assembly of Polymer Nanofilms via Surfactant-Regulated Marangoni Instability"], "prompt": "Q: Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nInterfacial polymerization (IP) provides a versatile platform for fabricating defect-free functional nanofilms for various applications, including molecular separation, energy, electronics, and biomedical materials.

create a more uniform positive charge distribution on the surface of the polyamide (PA) membrane. This uniformity allows for more effective electrostatic repulsion of free Mg2+ ions, leading to a significantly higher separation factor (SLi,Mg) for lithium over magnesium, even in high magnesium-to-lithium feed conditions. In contrast, the larger size and steric effects of ARM monomers result in larger charge gaps that are less effective at repelling Mg2+, ultimately reducing the membrane's selectivity and performance.", "correct": false}

than that of Li+, complicating the extraction of Li+ due to the competitive presence of Mg2+.\n\n3. **Complexity of Separation Techniques**: Various methods for separation, such as electrodialysis, adsorption, extraction, and nanofiltration, have been explored, but each has limitations in terms of efficiency, cost, and operational conditions.\n\n4. **Economic Viability**: The separation processes must be economically feasible, and the costs associated with advanced techniques can be high, especially for large-scale operations.\n\n5. **Environmental Considerations**: The need to

ion separation processes.", "confidence": [-0.29588791728019714, -0.0034450457897037268, -1.9743012671824545e-05, -0.07889848947525024, -1.9361264946837764e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.49843448400497437,

Membranes with higher chitosan content exhibited higher decomposition temperatures (~350 °C) compared to the pristine cellulose membrane (M5), which had a decomposition temperature of 300 °C. This enhancement in thermal stability is attributed to the entanglement of chitosan within the cellulose chains, which provides additional structural support. Additionally, the blend membranes showed less pronounced weight loss at lower temperatures, indicating better retention of adsorbed water. Overall, the incorporation of chitosan not only increased thermal stability but also improved the mechanical properties of the membranes, making them more suitable for filtration applications.", "correct": false}

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of these mechanisms:\n\n1. **Size Exclusion**: The primary mechanism for rejection in TFC-PA membranes is size-based sieving. The membrane has a selective layer with pores that can physically block larger solutes based on their Stokes radius (rs). For solutes with a Stokes radius between 2.5 and 5.0 Å, the membrane can effectively reject those that are too large to pass through the pores.\n\n2. **Electrostatic Interactions**: In addition to size, the TFC-PA membrane has charged functional groups that can interact with ions in the solution. These electrostatic interactions can enhance rejection for charged species. For example, if the membrane surface is negatively charged, it will repel negatively charged ions (anions) while attracting positively charged ions (cations). This means that even ions of similar size can be rejected based on their charge.\n\n3. **Ion Dehydration**: Another important mechanism is ion dehydration. Ions in solution are surrounded by a hydration shell of water molecules. When these ions approach the membrane, they must shed some of their water molecules to pass through the membrane. This dehydration process requires energy and can be more difficult for larger or highly charged ions. As a result, ions that are more difficult to dehydrate will be rejected more effectively by the membrane.\n\n4. **Combination of Mechanisms**: The wide range of rejection observed for solutes of similar size indicates that these mechanisms do not operate in isolation. Instead, the rejection of ions is a complex interplay of size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, and the energy barrier associated with ion dehydration. This combination allows the TFC-PA membranes to achieve a broad spectrum of selectivity for different solutes.\n\nIn summary, the rejection of species by TFC-PA membranes is influenced by their size, charge, and the energy required for ion dehydration, leading to a nuanced and effective filtration process.", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful membrane science assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: What is the mechanism for TFC-PA membranes to reject species？\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe TFC-PA membrane formed via conventional IP has a very wide range of rejection for solutes with Stokes radius, rs, between 2.5 and 5.0 Å (Fig. 1e, top).

interact with ions in the solution, enhancing rejection based on charge. For example, negatively charged membranes repel anions and attract cations.\n\n3. **Ion Dehydration**: Ions must shed their hydration shells to pass through the membrane, which can be energetically unfavorable for larger or highly charged ions, leading to increased rejection.\n\nThese mechanisms work together, allowing TFC-PA membranes to achieve a wide range of rejection for solutes with similar sizes, indicating that both size and charge play significant roles in the filtration process.", "correct": false}

distribution through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Enhanced PIP Diffusion**: SDS promotes the trans-interface transport of PIP (polyamide precursor), leading to more uniform diffusion across the water-hexane interface. This uniformity is crucial for creating a membrane with consistent pore sizes.\n\n2. **Lower Energy Barriers**: Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that a lower energy barrier for PIP diffusion results in faster and more uniform flux. As the energy barrier decreases, the number of successful diffusion attempts increases, and the variation in the number of particles passing through each grid opening decreases, contributing to uniformity in pore formation.\n\n3. **Steric Hindrance**: The self-assembled SDS network at the interface imposes steric hindrance, which limits the diffusion of newly formed PA fragments back into the water. This reduces competing hydrolysis reactions, allowing for a higher degree of crosslinking in the PA membrane.\n\n4. **Synergistic Effects**: The combination of enhanced PIP diffusion and suppressed hydrolysis leads to increased crosslinking, resulting in a more stable and homogeneous membrane structure with a uniform pore size distribution.\n\nIn summary, SDS aids in achieving a uniform pore size distribution in PA membranes by enhancing PIP diffusion, lowering energy barriers, and promoting crosslinking while suppressing undesirable reactions.", "correct": false}

mechanisms:\n\n1. **Generation of Ultrasonic Waves**: High-frequency sound waves are generated and propagated through the liquid surrounding the membrane.\n\n2. **Cavitation Bubble Formation**: When the ultrasonic intensity exceeds the Blake threshold acoustic pressure, cavitation bubbles form in the liquid.\n\n3. **Shear Stress from Bubble Collapse**: The movement and subsequent collapse of these bubbles create intense shear stress at the membrane surface, which helps dislodge and remove accumulated foulants.\n\n4. **Production of Reactive Radicals**: The extreme conditions during bubble collapse lead to the pyrolysis of water, generating highly reactive radicals such as hydrogen radicals (·H) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH).\n\n5. **Degradation of Organic Pollutants**: These reactive radicals can rapidly react with and degrade organic pollutants that contribute to membrane fouling.\n\n6. **Enhanced Membrane Performance**: By cleaning the membrane surface and degrading foulants, ultrasonic technology improves filtration efficiency and extends the membrane's operational lifespan.\n\nIn summary, ultrasonic technology effectively controls membrane fouling by combining physical cleaning through cavitation with chemical degradation of pollutants, leading to enhanced membrane performance.", "correct": false}

Instead, it attempts to explicitly obtain this structure by numerical solution of diffusion and reaction equations. The model reveals that the stage of diffusion-limited growth is preceded by a very different kinetic regimesincipient film formationsthat, in some cases, may shape the final structure and morphology of the film. The important points may be summarized as follows:18,19 (1) The model predicts rapid formation of a film of finite thickness, followed by an abrupt slowdown of the interfacial polymerization process. (2) The thickness of the incipient film decreases slowly with a decrease in concentration of either of the monomers. (3) Both the reactivity of the monomer and thickness of the boundary diffusion layer (i.e., hydrodynamic conditions) affect the film thickness. (4) The polymer film possesses a dense core (the actual barrier) hidden inside a looser polymer structure. (5) The dense core separates the film into two distinct regions, in each of which one type of monomer and end group is in large excess over the other.

S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time. This result proves that the aqueous solution volume or total monomer amount control provides an effective way to adjust the reaction kinetics, polymerization window, and polyamide growth. On the other hand, the reaction kinetics can also be reflected by the consumption rate of trimesoyl chloride, which can be obtained by in situ monitoring its concentration change according to the positive linear relationship between the concentration and the absorbance peak of the organic solution at 290 nm (Figs.

Lower trimesoyl chloride was consumed with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time, indicating that the participation of trimesoyl chloride in the reaction can also be controlled. These results mean that the reaction between the two monomers can be confined remarkably by limiting the total amount of the diamine monomer solution, which accounts for the reduced thickness of polyamide nanofilms (Fig. 2). According to the monitoring of the reaction kinetics of interfacial polymerization, the regulation mechanism is proposed (Fig. 3D). At the initial stage of the reaction, a high local piperazine concentration can promote the reaction between piperazine and trimesoyl chloride to form an integral nanofilm.

Monomer Concentration**: By varying the total amount of diamine monomer (piperazine) in the solution while keeping the reaction interface fixed, the concentration of piperazine at the interface can be manipulated. This is achieved by adjusting the solution volume rather than the concentration of piperazine.\n\n2. **Impact on Reaction Kinetics**: A lower total amount of piperazine leads to a more rapid decrease in its concentration near the interface, which reduces the diffusion rate of piperazine to the reaction zone. This slower diffusion can hinder the formation of the polyamide nanofilm.\n\n3. **Polyamide Growth Regulation**: The reduced total amount of piperazine results in less participation in the reaction over the same time period, leading to thinner polyamide films. The consumption of trimesoyl chloride also decreases under these conditions, indicating that the reaction can be effectively confined.\n\n4. **Early Termination of Reaction**: Initially, a high local concentration of piperazine promotes the reaction with trimesoyl chloride, forming a nanofilm. However, as piperazine is consumed, its concentration drops quickly, causing the reaction to terminate earlier and preventing excessive growth of the nanofilm.\n\n5. **Guideline for Film Thickness Control**: This mechanism provides a guideline for controlling interfacial polymerization, allowing for the tuning of the structure and properties of polyamide nanofilms by limiting the total amount of diamine monomer.\n\nIn summary, the mechanism relies on the strategic manipulation of monomer concentrations and reaction kinetics to achieve ultrathin nanofilms on Janus substrates.", "correct": false}

Control**: It may not effectively confine the aqueous solution of amine monomers, leading to uneven distribution and inconsistent film properties.\n\n2. **Reaction Rate Regulation**: The lack of a

have defects, larger pore sizes, or compromised mechanical properties, which are undesirable for applications like nanofiltration.\n\n4. **Thickness Control**: Achieving precise control over the nanofilm thickness is challenging, leading to variability that can affect performance characteristics.\n\n5. **Performance Trade-offs**: Conventional substrates may not allow for the optimization of both permeability and rejection rates, which is critical for effective nanofiltration.\n\n6. **Scalability and Practicality**: Limitations in conventional substrates can hinder the scalability of the

The rejections of membranes for different salts followed the order: MgCl2 > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 > NaCl. This can be explained in terms of sieving and dielectric exclusion effects. The hydrated ionic radii of salts followed the order: magnesium (0.43 nm) > sulphate (0.38 nm) > sodium (0.36 nm) > chloride(0.33 nm). Therefore, the rejection of membrane was biggest for MgCl2 while it was smallest for NaCl at fixed gallic acid concentrations and PEI concentration in coating solution. Moreover, the selective layer of prepared membrane became denser with increasing gallic acid concentrations at fixed PEI concentration in coating solution, therefore the rejections of the loose NF membranes for all salt were repectively increased due to the steric effect. Meanwhile, as observed from Fig. 10, the obvious variation of the zeta potential (from 25.06 mV to 16.64 mV) had not been observed and the surface charge of the membrane was still dominated by the charge of PEI layer.

For example, the order of rejection for the salts tested (MgCl2, MgSO4, Na2SO4, NaCl) correlates with their hydrated ionic sizes. Larger hydrated ions, such as magnesium (0.43 nm), are rejected more effectively than smaller ions like sodium (0.36 nm) and chloride (0.33 nm). This is due to the sieving effect, where larger ions are physically blocked from passing through the membrane pores.\n\n2. **Sieving and Dielectric Exclusion Effects**: The rejection mechanism involves both sieving (size exclusion) and dielectric exclusion, where the membrane's charge affects the movement of ions.

"prediction": "The rejection performance of loose nanofiltration membranes is affected by several factors:\n\n1. **Ionic Size and Hydration**: The hydrated ionic radii of the salts influence rejection rates, with larger ions being rejected more effectively. For example, MgCl2 is rejected more than NaCl due to the larger size of the magnesium ion.\n\n2. **Sieving and Dielectric Exclusion Effects**: The rejection mechanism involves both size exclusion (sieving) and electrostatic interactions (dielectric exclusion). Bivalent ions (e.g., Mg2+) experience greater electrostatic repulsion compared to monovalent ions (e.g., Na+), leading to higher rejection rates for bivalent salts.\n\n3. **Membrane Surface Charge (Zeta Potential)**: The zeta potential of the membrane affects its interaction with ions. A higher cation density in the modified PEI layer enhances electrostatic repulsion for bivalent ions, improving their rejection.\n\n4. **Concentration of Coating Solution Components**: Increasing the concentration of gallic acid in the coating solution leads to a denser selective layer, which enhances rejection due to steric effects.\n\n5. **Type of Salt**: The specific type of salt also impacts rejection performance, with bivalent salts generally being rejected more effectively than monovalent salts.\n\nIn summary, the rejection performance of loose nanofiltration membranes is influenced by ionic size, membrane surface charge, the concentration of coating components, and the type of salts present.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00116", "question": "What role does tannic acid (TA) play in the TA@BM-Spray membrane?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe modifier TA, a cost-effective polyphenol derived from plants, contains catechol and galloyl groups that exhibit excellent coating ability. It can adhere to various substrate surfaces via covalent and/or noncovalent bonding, enabling the functionalization of liposomes with a hydrophilic surface and yolk-shell structure. Evidently, the spray-assisted integration of TA-encapsulated liposomes ensures uniform predeposition upon the substrate surface, guaranteeing a PA layer with an analogously crumpled and rough structural profile as observed in liposome-incorporated membranes. The introduction of TA mitigates potential non-selective defects through chemical interactions with reactive monomers and liposomes (e. g., Schiff base reaction, Michael addition, hydrogen bonding and acylation, etc.), as well as the strong adsorption ability onto the PSf substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. As a compatibility promoter, TA plays a critical role in establishing a robust interfacial bridge between the liposomes and PA active layer at the molecular level. Simultaneously, as a hydrophilic enhancer, TA introduces multiple hydrophilic sites enveloping the liposomes, making them more water-contactable and contributing to the formation of a highly hydrophilic membrane surface. In conjunction with the TA@liposomes-assisted protuberances and nanovoids, which enhance membrane surface roughness and effective surface area, along with improvement in surface hydrophilicity and cross-linking degree, these structural and physicochemical features of the TA@BM-Spray membrane collectively achieve enhanced water permeance and water-salt selectivity.", "label": ["Chemical interactions with reactive monomers and substrates reduce potential non-selective defects.

properties in several ways:\n\n1. **Coating and Adhesion**: TA's excellent coating ability allows it to adhere effectively to various substrate surfaces, facilitating the functionalization of liposomes.\n\n2. **Uniform Liposome Integration**: The spray-assisted integration of TA-encapsulated liposomes ensures uniform predeposition on the substrate, resulting in a polyamide (PA) layer that mimics the crumpled and rough structure of the liposomes.\n\n3. **Defect Mitigation**: TA helps reduce non-selective defects through chemical interactions with reactive monomers and liposomes, such as Schiff base reactions and hydrogen bonding, leading to a more stable membrane structure.\n\n4. **Strong Substrate Adsorption**: TA's strong adsorption onto the polysulfone (PSf) substrate enhances the adhesion between the substrate and the PA layer, contributing to the membrane's durability.\n\n5. **Compatibility Promotion**: TA acts as a compatibility promoter, establishing a robust interfacial bridge between the liposomes and the PA active layer, which is essential for the membrane's integrity.\n\n6. **Hydrophilicity Enhancement**: By introducing multiple hydrophilic sites around the liposomes, TA increases the membrane's hydrophilicity, improving water contact and permeance.\n\n7. **Surface Roughness and Effective Area**: The presence of TA@liposomes creates protuberances and nanovoids on the membrane surface, enhancing surface roughness and effective surface area, which improves water permeance and water-salt selectivity.\n\nIn summary, tannic acid significantly enhances the performance of the TA@BM-Spray membrane by improving its hydrophilicity, structural integrity, and overall efficiency in water treatment applications.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00117", "question": "How do nanovesicles influence the morphology of the PA layer? And explain the role of nanovesicles in enhancing water permeance.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nTo comprehensively rationalize the observed separation performances, we initially reassess the design of the bioinspired SWRO membranes. Characterization results demonstrate that the nanovesicleintegrated PA selective layer differs significantly from its nanovesiclefree counterpart. Traditionally, amine monomers undergo diffusion across the aqueous phase to react with the organic monomers at the immiscible interface, forming a dense selective layer with minimal nanovoids and restricted effective surface area. This results in relatively low water permeance and moderate salt rejection. Nevertheless, the incorporation of E. coli-based liposomes via conventional blending or spray-assisted predeposition increases the diffusion rate and penetration depth of amine monomers into the organic phase. This effect is mainly owing to the creation of a broader “miscible region” at the reaction interface, driven by lower interfacial tension, which results in a PA morphology with greater protuberance and a rougher structure (Fig. 7a). In the BM-Conv and BM-spray membranes, this crumpled structure, characterized by a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, along with the lower hydrodynamic resistance from increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer, collectively facilitates the water transport of the liposomesincorporated membranes. However, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes due to the increased monomer supply and the local temperature rise can destabilize incipient PA oligomers, leading to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix. This contributes to higher water permeance but compromises water-salt selectivity. More importantly, the formation of additional channels and non-selective defects between the unreactive liposomes and the PA layer, as well as substrate, due to poor interfacial compatibility, further accounts for the slight decline in salt rejection observed in membranes embedded with unmodified liposomes. Despite this, the bioinspired membranes fabricated using conventional blending and spray-assisted strategies demonstrated comparable separation performance. Notably, the amount of liposomes required for the spray-assisted membrane was only 3.8 % of that needed for the blending strategy, indicating that the spraying approach allows precise control of liposome deposition and minimizes wastage of valuable additives, ensuring high utilization efficiency.", "label": ["They reduce interfacial tension, promoting amine monomer diffusion and forming a rougher structure.

Nevertheless, the incorporation of E. coli-based liposomes via conventional blending or spray-assisted predeposition increases the diffusion rate and penetration depth of amine monomers into the organic phase. This effect is mainly owing to the creation of a broader “miscible region” at the reaction interface, driven by lower interfacial tension, which results in a PA morphology with greater protuberance and a rougher structure (Fig. 7a). In the BM-Conv and BM-spray membranes, this crumpled structure, characterized by a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, along with the lower hydrodynamic resistance from increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer, collectively facilitates the water transport of the liposomesincorporated membranes. However, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes due to the increased monomer supply and the local temperature rise can destabilize incipient PA oligomers, leading to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix. This contributes to higher water permeance but compromises water-salt selectivity. More importantly, the formation of additional channels and non-selective defects between the unreactive liposomes and the PA layer, as well as substrate, due to poor interfacial compatibility, further accounts for the slight decline in salt rejection observed in membranes embedded with unmodified liposomes. Despite this, the bioinspired membranes fabricated using conventional blending and spray-assisted strategies demonstrated comparable separation performance.

This process typically results in a selective layer with minimal nanovoids and a restricted effective surface area, leading to lower water permeance and moderate salt rejection.\n\n2. **Role of Nanovesicles**: The incorporation of E. coli-based liposomes (nanovesicles) into the membrane fabrication process alters the dynamics of the reaction. The presence of these liposomes increases the diffusion rate and penetration depth of amine monomers into the organic phase.

This morphology results in a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, which are beneficial for water transport. The increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids beneath the PA active layer further reduce hydrodynamic resistance, facilitating water flow through the membrane.\n\n4. **Water Permeance Enhancement**: The combination of a rougher surface, increased surface area, and reduced resistance allows for higher water permeance in membranes that incorporate nanovesicles. Additionally, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes—due to increased monomer supply and local temperature rise—can lead to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix, which also contributes to higher water permeance.\n\n5. **Trade-offs in Selectivity**: While the incorporation of nanovesicles enhances water permeance, it can compromise water-salt selectivity.

The spray-assisted strategy requires significantly less liposome material compared to conventional blending, allowing for precise control over liposome deposition and minimizing waste. This ensures high utilization efficiency of the additives while maintaining comparable separation performance.\n\nIn summary, nanovesicles influence the morphology of the PA layer by creating a more favorable reaction environment that enhances the surface area and porosity of the membrane.

coli-based liposomes, significantly influences the morphology of the polyamide (PA) layer in membrane fabrication. This integration alters the reaction dynamics, leading to a broader \"miscible region\" at the interface due to lower interfacial tension. As a result, the PA layer exhibits a crumpled structure with greater protuberance and roughness, which increases the effective surface area and enhances wettability.\n\nThese morphological changes facilitate higher water permeance by reducing hydrodynamic resistance through increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids beneath the PA active layer. Additionally, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes contributes to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix, further enhancing water permeance.\n\nHowever, this enhancement in water permeance may compromise water-salt selectivity due to the formation of additional channels and non-selective defects between the unreactive liposomes and the PA layer, as well as poor interfacial compatibility. Despite this trade-off, the use of nanovesicles, particularly through efficient methods like spray-assisted deposition, allows for precise control and high utilization efficiency of the additives, resulting in comparable separation performance to traditional methods.", "correct": false}
{"id": "test-00118", "question": "What factors contributed to the high rejection of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe membranes were also tested for salt rejection (Fig. 10) and they showed good rejection for divalent ions with rejection > 90%. For membrane PA-100, the rejections of CaCl2, MgCl2 and MgSO4 were 94.3, 95.2 and 91.6%, respectively. However, the rejections of Na2SO4 and NaCl were only 65.3 and 36.4, respectively. The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius. When tested using salt solution with a higher concentration 2000 ppm, the membrane still showed good rejection of MgCl2 and MgSO4, with a rejection rate of 94.1 and 91.5%, respectively. However, the consistently relatively lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 at both feed concentrations could not be fully explained using the steric hindrance effect. To further understand the salt rejection results, the surface charge of the membranes were measured and the zeta potential results are presented in Fig. 11. The zeta potential of the tubular membrane was measured using the streaming potential method at pH ranging from 3 to 9.5. The ceramic substrate had an isoelectric point at about pH 5, exhibiting anionic surface charge under pH > 5. However, the isoelectric points of both of the membrane PA-100 and PA-200 shifted significantly towards a higher pH but were not determined during the measurement due to the limited pH range of the equipment. Isoelectric points at a relatively high pH were observed previously when mixed PEI and PIP  was used as the polyamide monomers [45]. The PEI-based polyamide membranes exhibited positively charged surface for a large pH range including at pH of the fed solution in this study (∼pH 6.5). The positively charged surface was mainly attributed to the protonation of unreacted amine groups in the membranes. Therefore, the higher rejection of divalent ions could also be contributed by the Donnan effect [46]. However, the positive field on the membrane surface could be greatly affected by divalent counter-ion SO4  2−. The lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 could be due to the weakened Donnan effect. Nevertheless, the rejection of MgSO4 was still > 90%, higher than many PEI-based polyamide membranes with a positively charged surface, which could be due to the tighter polyamide network as the result of the addition of PIP in this study.", "label": ["Divalent ions have larger hydrated radii"], "prompt": "Q: What factors contributed to the high rejection of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe membranes were also tested for salt rejection (Fig. 10) and they showed good rejection for divalent ions with rejection > 90%.

The positively charged surface was mainly attributed to the protonation of unreacted amine groups in the membranes. Therefore, the higher rejection of divalent ions could also be contributed by the Donnan effect [46]. However, the positive field on the membrane surface could be greatly affected by divalent counter-ion SO4  2−. The lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 could be due to the weakened Donnan effect. Nevertheless, the rejection of MgSO4 was still > 90%, higher than many PEI-based polyamide membranes with a positively charged surface, which could be due to the tighter polyamide network as the result of the addition of PIP in this study.\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction_rationale": "The high rejection of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Steric Hindrance**: Divalent ions, such as Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, have larger hydrated radii compared to monovalent ions like Na⁺. This larger size leads to greater steric hindrance when these ions attempt to pass through the membrane pores, resulting in higher rejection rates for divalent salts.\n\n2. **Hydration Shell Size**: The hydration shells of divalent ions are generally larger than those of monovalent ions. This means that when divalent ions are hydrated, they occupy more space, making it more difficult for them to permeate through the membrane compared to smaller, monovalent ions.\n\n3. **Donnan Effect**: The surface charge of the membrane plays a significant role in ion rejection. In this case, the positively charged surface of the membrane (due to protonation of unreacted amine groups) attracts negatively charged ions, such as SO₄²⁻. The presence of these negatively charged ions can enhance the rejection of divalent cations due to the Donnan effect, which describes how the distribution of ions across a membrane is influenced by the charge of the membrane.\n\n4. **Counter-Ion Interaction**: The interaction between the positively charged membrane surface and the negatively charged sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) can weaken the Donnan effect for certain divalent salts, such as MgSO₄, compared to others like MgCl₂. This could explain why the rejection of MgSO₄ is lower than that of MgCl₂, despite both being divalent salts.\n\n5. **Membrane Structure**: The tighter polyamide network resulting from the addition of PIP in the membrane fabrication process may also contribute to the overall rejection performance. A tighter network can create smaller pores that are less permeable to larger hydrated ions.\n\n6. **pH Influence**: The isoelectric point of the membrane shifts with pH, affecting the surface charge and, consequently, the rejection characteristics. The positively charged surface at the pH of the feed solution (around pH 6.5) enhances the rejection of negatively charged divalent ions.\n\nIn summary, the combination of steric hindrance, hydration shell size, the Donnan effect, counter-ion interactions, membrane structure, and pH influence all contribute to the observed high rejection rates of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts in the tested membranes.", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful membrane science assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: What factors contributed to the high rejection of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts?\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nThe membranes were also tested for salt rejection (Fig. 10) and they showed good rejection for divalent ions with rejection > 90%. For membrane PA-100, the rejections of CaCl2, MgCl2 and MgSO4 were 94.3, 95.2 and 91.6%, respectively. However, the rejections of Na2SO4 and NaCl were only 65.3 and 36.4, respectively. The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius. When tested using salt solution with a higher concentration 2000 ppm, the membrane still showed good rejection of MgCl2 and MgSO4, with a rejection rate of 94.1 and 91.5%, respectively. However, the consistently relatively lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 at both feed concentrations could not be fully explained using the steric hindrance effect. To further understand the salt rejection results, the surface charge of the membranes were measured and the zeta potential results are presented in Fig. 11. The zeta potential of the tubular membrane was measured using the streaming potential method at pH ranging from 3 to 9.5. The ceramic substrate had an isoelectric point at about pH 5, exhibiting anionic surface charge under pH > 5. However, the isoelectric points of both of the membrane PA-100 and PA-200 shifted significantly towards a higher pH but were not determined during the measurement due to the limited pH range of the equipment. Isoelectric points at a relatively high pH were observed previously when mixed PEI and PIP  was used as the polyamide monomers [45].

Divalent ions (e.g., Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺) have larger hydrated radii than monovalent ions (e.g., Na⁺), leading to greater steric hindrance and making it more difficult for them to pass through the membrane.\n\n2. **Hydration Shell Size**: The larger hydration shells of divalent ions occupy more space, further reducing their ability to permeate the membrane compared to smaller monovalent ions.\n\n3. **Donnan Effect**: The positively charged surface of the membrane attracts negatively charged ions (e.g., SO₄²⁻), enhancing the rejection of divalent cations due to the electrostatic interactions.\n\n4. **Counter-Ion Interaction**: The interaction between the membrane's positive charge and negatively charged sulfate ions can weaken the Donnan effect for certain divalent salts, such as MgSO₄, leading to lower rejection rates compared to other divalent salts like MgCl₂.\n\n5. **Membrane Structure**: The tighter polyamide network created during membrane fabrication contributes to higher rejection rates by creating smaller pores that are less permeable to larger hydrated ions.\n\n6. **pH Influence**: The surface charge of the membrane changes with pH, affecting ion rejection characteristics. The positively charged surface at the feed solution's pH enhances the rejection of negatively charged divalent ions.\n\nIn summary, the combination of these factors results in significantly higher rejection rates for divalent salts compared to monovalent salts in the tested membranes.", "correct": false}

The PES substrate presented a smooth and porous surface morphology, while a rough and compact surface with irregular topography was observed for the cLBL membrane (Fig. 4(B)). This characterization once again confirms a full coverage of polyelectrolyte depositions on the substrate.

After the introduction of a crosslinked PDA/PEI layer, a rougher surface with grainy and convex nanostructures was observed for the LBL-cPP membrane (Fig. 4 (C) and Fig. A3(D)). This indicated fewer visible PDA aggregates were deposited on the LBL layer. This phenomenon could be attributed to the diminishing of non-covalent interactions in the PDA aggregates caused by nucleophilic amine groups of the PEI molecules [27]. Meanwhile, the aggregation of PDA was also disrupted by the size control-inhibition mechanism of polyelectrolytes as discussed above.

This mechanism prevents excessive aggregation, resulting in a more uniform distribution of PDA on the membrane.\n\n3. **Surface Morphology Improvement**: The addition of PEI contributes to a rougher surface with grainy and convex nanostructures, which is beneficial for enhancing the membrane's properties, such as permeability and selectivity.\n\n4. **Homogeneous Surface Tailoring**: The co-deposition of PDA and PEI results in a more homogeneous surface on the nanofiltration (NF) membrane, which is crucial for its performance in filtration applications.\n\n5. **Increased Thickness**: The incorporation of the crosslinked PDA/PEI layer significantly increases the thickness of the membrane, indicating a successful deposition and anchoring of the layer on the surface.\n\nIn summary, the addition of PEI during co-deposition serves to control PDA aggregation, improve surface morphology, and enhance the overall characteristics of the membrane, leading to better performance in filtration applications."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your thought, therefore, the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary purpose of adding PEI to the dopamine solution during co-deposition was to disrupt the aggregation of polydopamine (PDA) by utilizing the nucleophilic amine groups of PEI, which diminished non-covalent interactions in PDA aggregates.

{"id": "test-00120", "question": "Explain the mechanism behind the improved RO performance when using LBL-cPP permeate as feed.\nYou can refer to the following context for your answer:\nDue to superior rejection of the LBLcPP membrane, the permeate of LBL-cPP presented lower TOC  (∼90.6% lower), Ca2+ (∼76.9% lower), Mg2+ (∼95.6% lower) and  Na+ (∼40.4% lower) as compared to the feed solution, which was better than that of NF 270 and cLBL processes. The EEM fluorescence spectra provide better understanding of the organic compositions in the permeate for each process as well as its surface foulants. As depicted in Fig. 10 (A), the EEM plots for feed solution were classified into four sections - I (humic-like substances; Ex > 280 nm, Em > 380 nm), II (protein-like substances; Ex = 250–280 nm, Em < 380 nm), III (fulvic acid-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em > 380 nm), and IV (tyrosine-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em = 330–380 nm) [51]. A distinct peak for tyrosine-like substances (IV) could be observed in feed solution, which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids. After the filtrations, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV) decreased by 84.2%, 89.3% and 93.9% for the permeates of the NF 270, cLBL and LBL-cPP membranes, respectively, compared to the feed solution, indicating better removal efficiency for tyrosine-like substances. In particular, the LBL-cPP membrane presented significant removal efficiency (decreased by 96.1%) for protein-like substances (II) from the feed solution, which was confirmed by its almost disappearing peak intensity (Fig. 10 (A)). Hence, the LBL-cPP membrane has a higher capacity to provide better permeate quality. It should be noted a small amount of fulvic acid-like substances (III) were identified in the permeate of all NF membranes. This is most likely due to their smaller molecular weights than the MWCOs of the NF membranes.

(RO) performance when using LBL-cPP permeate as feed can be attributed to several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Superior Rejection Capabilities**: The LBL-cPP membrane demonstrates significantly higher rejection rates for total organic carbon (TOC), calcium ions (Ca²⁺), magnesium ions (Mg²⁺), and sodium ions (Na⁺) compared to other membranes like NF 270 and cLBL. This results in a permeate with much lower concentrations of these contaminants.\n\n2. **Effective Removal of Organic Compounds**: The LBL-cPP membrane excels in removing various organic substances, particularly protein-like substances, which are known to contribute to membrane fouling. The membrane achieves a remarkable 96.1% reduction in protein-like substances, leading to a cleaner permeate.\n\n3. **Reduced Foulant Accumulation**: The hydrophilic nature of the LBL-cPP membrane minimizes the adsorption of larger organic molecules, such as humic-like and protein-like substances, onto its surface. This results in less fouling and a cleaner membrane surface, which is crucial for maintaining performance.\n\n4. **Higher Permeate Quality**: The combination of superior rejection and effective foulant removal leads to a higher quality permeate, characterized by lower concentrations of organic and ionic contaminants. This enhances the overall efficiency of the RO process.\n\n5. **Consistent Flux Performance**: The improved quality of the permeate is reflected in the consistent flux profile of the LBL-cPP membrane, indicating sustained performance over time without significant fouling-related declines.\n\nIn summary, the enhanced RO performance when using LBL-cPP permeate as feed is due to the membrane's superior rejection capabilities, effective removal of foulants, reduced fouling propensity, and the resulting high-quality permeate produced.", "correct": false}

Consider the PEI/TMC membrane composition:\n- PEI = Polyethyleneimine (typically positively charged)\n- TMC = Trimethyl chitosan (can have positive or neutral charge)\n\n3. Membrane surface characteristics:\n- The front and rear surfaces might have different charge characteristics\n- Layer-by-layer deposition can create charge variations\n- Surface modification techniques can influence zeta potential\n\n4. Without specific experimental data, we need to consider typical membrane behaviors:\n- Often, different surfaces of multilayer membranes have slight charge variations\n- The manufacturing process can introduce subtle charge differences\n\n5. Typical expectation:\n- If the surfaces have different charge characteristics\n- Most likely scenario would be a slight positive charge difference\n\n6.

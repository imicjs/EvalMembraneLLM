The irregular morphology precludes quantification of a single film layer thickness, but both thin films are about 50–200 nm. In Fig. 3(c), zeolite nanoparticles appear considerably darker than the polymer and are clearly located within the cross-section of the thin film, but also at the interface.Key: In TEM images, they can be shown in a darker color within the cross-section in the membrane.

       " '17\\\\Q: Explain the Janus surface charge phenomenon in polyamide membranes.Context: Consequently, the rear surface exhibited a smaller O/N ratio compared to the front surface. More specifically, for PEI/TMC membrane, the O/N ratio of the front surface is 1.88, more than twice that of the rear surface (0.9). However, this huge O/N ratio difference is not observed on PIP/TMC membrane. This can be attributed to the significant molecular size difference between PIP and PEI. In a typical interfacial polymerization process, the small amine monomers (PIP) can easily pass through the nascent polyamide film into the organic phase to continuously react with TMC until a thick and dense polyamide layer is formed. However, the branched PEI with a molecular weight of 70000 Da is much larger than that of PIP (Mw = 86 Da), thus much more difficult to pass the nascent polyamide films to react with acyl chloride monomer (Fig. 2b and c). It is more likely that just part of the PEI branches pass the nascent polyamide film and join in the reaction, while  the other part of PEI was left in the aqueous phase side, resulting in an insufficient amine groups in organic phase. Consequently, many not fully reacted acyl chloride groups in TMC monomers finally hydrolyzed into carboxyl groups. In comparison to the PIP/TMC membrane, the front surface of the PEI/TMC membrane displays a greater concentration of O. Likewise, higher levels of N are observed on the rear surface of the PEI/TMC membrane than on the PIP/TMC membrane. This observation was further confirmed by the core-level XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. 1c–f). PEI/TMC rear surface exhibited a higher unreacted –NH2 content (56.09 %) than that of front surface (21.21 %) combined with a lower N–C=O content (9.59 %) than that of front surface (31.45 %).Key: This asymmetry arises from the interfacial polymerization process. The front surface (exposed to TMC) is enriched with carboxyl groups.  And the rear surface (exposed to amine monomers) has unreacted amine groups. (Journal of Membrane Science 713(2025)123284)',\n",
       " '18\\\\Q: Why do different aqueous monomers PEI and PIP form membrane with different performance?Context: The UV–vis spectrometer was used to monitor the diffusion of PIP and PEI molecules from the aqueous phase into the organic phase during the interfacial polymerization process. PIP exhibits an absorption peak  at 228 nm, and its absorbance demonstrates a linear correlation with the concentration of PIP in the aqueous solution. Therefore, changes in absorbance can be utilized to quantify the diffusion rate of PIP (refer to Fig. S6 for the standard curve depicting the relationship between the absorbance value and the concentration of PIP/PEI in the aqueous solution.). As shown in Fig. 2a, the reduction of PIP concentration in the aqueous phase is much greater than that of PEI, indicating the PEI is more difficult to diffuse through the nascent polyamide because of the relatively large molecular weight of PEI. More specifically, after reaction for 60s, the concentration of PEI in water stabilizes, while the PIP concentration remains stable until 170 s, suggesting that self-confined reaction between PEI and TMC stopped earlier than that of reaction between PIP and TMC because of the relatively large monomer size compared to PIP.Key: Different monomer diffusion rate during interfacial polymerization.

These polyamide membranes fabricated through interfacial polymerization normally exhibit a front surface enriched with carboxyl groups and a rear surface enriched with amine groups, rendering it with a Janus surface charge. However, this disparity in charge properties between the two surfaces has not been thoroughly investigated, despite its importance in understanding the membrane formation mechanism. In this study, polyethylenimine (PEI, Mw = 70000 Da) and piperazine (PIP, Mw = 86 Da), with distinct molecular size, were employed as aqueous monomers to react with trimesoyl chloride (TMC) at a support-free water hexane interface to synthesize polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The charge differences in the rear and front surface of PEI/TMC and PIP/TMC nanofiltration membrane was fully explored. The PEI/TMC membrane demonstrated a great charge disparity between the two surfaces with a negatively charged (isoelectric point = 5.62) front surface and a positively charged (isoelectric point = 9.59) rear surface. As a result, the rear surface exhibits a higher MgCl2 rejection (95.6 %) than the front surface (88.9 %). In contrast, the PIP/TMC membrane exhibited a similar negative charge and salt rejections on both surfaces. Moreover, the rear surface of PEI/TMC membrane exhibited a great anti-fouling performance to positively charged lysozyme (FDR = 51.1 %, FRR = 88.8 %).

We use a facile route based on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.Key: To develop polyamide membranes with nanoscale Turing structures for water purification.

       " '21\\\\Q: Is any additives used during membrane fabrication? If so, What role does it play in the synthesis of membranes?Context: Interfacial polymerization is a reaction-diffusion process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. It is based on the Schotten-Baumann reaction, in which the irreversible polymerization of two fast-reacting multifunctional monomers occurs near the interface of two immiscible phases of a heterogeneous liquid system. This technique has been used to prepare reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes for largescale and low-cost water purification applications. In a typical membrane synthesis, organic amines are dissolved in water while acyl chlorides are dissolved in an organic solvent, and a very thin insoluble polyamide (PA) membrane forms on top of a porous support. In our experiment, piperazine (PZ) is the activator, and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) is the inhibitor. The reaction is initiated when the top surface of a porous polysulfone (PSU) support containing an aqueous solution of the activator comes in contact with an organic solution of the  inhibitor. Because the acyl chloride has very little solubility in water, the polymerization occurs predominantly on the organic side of the interface. Initially, the activator reacts with the locally available inhibitor in the reaction zone, later it diffuses to penetrate more deeply into the reaction zone, and finally, a cross-linked PA membrane forms across the region of pore openings of the PSU support. This PA membrane formed by a conventional interfacial polymerization reaction is not of Turing type, for there are not appropriate differences between the diffusion coefficients of the activator and the inhibitor. During the reaction, the aqueous solution of the activator is confined within surface nanometer-sized pores of the PSU support, where physical obstruction blocks dispersed aqueous-phase movement and slows the activator transport. The diffusion coefficient of the organic molecules is around 10−5 cm2 s–1, whereas the diffusion of the dispersed aqueous phases in the organic phase can be as low as 10−6 cm2 s–1. When a certain amount of macromolecule, PVA, was added to the aqueous solution, it interacted with the activator via hydrogen bonding and increased solution viscosity, further reducing the diffusion rate of the activator. Through the synergetic effects of the physical obstruction and chemical interaction, the systems meet appropriate differences in the diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor, leading to a diffusion-driven instability and generating nanoscale spotted and striped Turing structures.Key: Yes, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). It reduces the diffusion rate of the activator through hydrogen bonding. (Science 360,518–521(2018))22\\\\ Q: Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.Context: Charged functional groups are often incorporated onto the surface of nanofiltration (NF) membranes to facilitate the selective rejection of multivalent ions over monovalent ions. However, since fouling-resistant surfaces tend to be electrically neutral, the incorporation of charged functionality exacerbates membrane fouling. Multifunctional Janus membrane architectures, which incorporate chemically distinct domains over their cross section, provide a strategy for balancing the competing demands associated with making fouling-resistant, ion rejecting NF membranes. Here, through the controlled exposure of poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate-co-oligo-(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)) copolymer substrates to a series of reactive solutions containing alkyne-terminated molecules, the process for creating dual-functional membranes by using the copper(I)-catalyzed azide−alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction was analyzed. Under the appropriate conditions, the CuAAC reaction propagates into the copolymer substrate as a front. This phenomenon results in a process for creating layered domains of distinct functionality whereby the distribution of antifouling zwitterionic moieties and ion rejecting sulfonate moieties can be modified by manipulating the exposure time. The ion rejection and fouling propensity for a family of dual-functional membranes was examined. For short initial reaction times, which introduced a thin antifouling layer on top of an ion rejection layer, the rejection of 1 mM K2SO4, 87%, was comparable to the value for full charge control membranes, 90%. Moreover, when exposed to a fouling solution containing bovine serum albumin (BSA), these dual-functional membranes exhibited an 18% decline in normalized flux and recovered 99% of their flux upon rinsing with water. In comparison, the full charge membranes exhibited a 44% decline in normalized flux and recovered 65% of their flux upon washing. As such, the results demonstrate that the controlled functionalization process reported here is capable of balancing antifouling and ion rejection capabilities. Furthermore, the versatile nature of the click chemistry mechanism at the center of this process offers a means by which to design and fabricate multifunctional membranes for numerous future applications.Key: Dual-Functional Nanofiltration Membranes Exhibit Multifaceted Ion Rejection and Antifouling Performance (ACS Appl.

       " '23\\\\Q: What is the main advantage of using click chemistry for membrane functionalization?Context: The copper(I)-catalyzed, azide−alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” reaction offers a promising technique for addressing the challenges associated with the fabrication of  Janus membranes. Since their initial development, numerous applications have been designed around the use of these rapid  and precise click reaction mechanisms. In regards to the functionalization of membranes, the fast rate of the reactions allows for the targeted introduction of chemical functionality. For example, the CuAAC reaction has been utilized to control the functionalization of azide-lined, track-etched pores via the electrochemical generation and diffusion of catalytically active  Cu(I) ions. In another example, the formulation and deposition of a reactive solution containing alkyne-terminated molecules on the membrane surface has been demonstrated to be a ready method for controlling the functionalization of membranes with exposed azide moieties lining the pore wall. Namely, in the appropriate limit the diffusion of reactive alkynes to exposed azide groups determines the rate of the CuAAC process which empowers controlled conversion  through specific exposure times.Key: High specificity and rapid reaction kinetics.

       " '24\\\\Q: Why is it unclear how adding surfactants to IP affects the nanostructure of the polyamide separation layer?Context: The addition of surfactants has often improved the separation performance of the PA nanofilm. However, the origins of its improved performance associated with its altered structures are still controversial because they were explained by different mechanisms, promoted monomer diffusion, improved support wettability, or their combination. Furthermore, combined with the unclear IP mechanism underlying PA film formation, many contradictory observations of the influence of surfactants on the performance of PA nanofilms make a clear identification of the surfactant regulated IP mechanism difficult. These ambiguities stem from the ill-defined interference of the support (e.g., distribution of the monomer concentration and the shape/uniformity of the reaction interface) in nanofilm formation via conventional IP  (Figure S2) and the lack of elaborate characterization tools for capturing a snapshot of the complex and nanoscale IP phenomena.Key: ill-defined interference of the support and the lack of elaborate characterization tools for capturing a snapshot of the complex and nanoscale IP  phenomena (Nano Lett. 2023,23,4822−4829)25\\\\ Q: Where does the impact of surfactants on IP mainly manifest?Context: A pristine PA nanofilm assembled without any surfactant exhibited a nanoscale thickness (∼24 nm) with small nodular surface features (Figure 1B and Figures S4 and S5), a dense structure with low molecular weight cut-off (MWCO, 84.7 g  mol−1) (Figure S6), and good RO performance (NaCl rejection = 99.2 ± 0.1%, water permeance = 0.77 ± 0.05 L  m−2 h−1 bar−1). The structure and RO performance of the PA nanofilms were sensitively regulated by adding surfactants depending on the surfactant charge characteristics (Figure 1C−E). Meanwhile, regardless of the surfactant type, surfactant addition enabled the assembly of the ultrapermselective PA nanofilm with ∼2.4-fold higher water permeance and intact NaCl rejection compared to the pristine film, albeit at different optimum surfactant concentrations. The addition of anionic SDS led to the most significant change in film structure and performance, producing a highly rough and  multilayered porous PA structure (Figure 1C and Figures S4 and S7). Higher SDS concentrations progressively increased film surface roughness while producing a highly crumpled leaflike structure (up to 1 mM SDS), which turned into a discrete and aggregated structure at SDS > 1 mM. This morphological change was accompanied by a drastic increase in the structural hierarchy, apparent thickness, internal void fraction, and backside porosity of the PA nanofilm (Figures S4 and S7). Meanwhile, a noticeable reduction in its NaCl rejection but an increase in its water permeance were observed at SDS > 1 mM (Figure 1C), where discrete PA aggregates began to appear. The evolution of the defective aggregates at SDS > 1 mM was closely related to the significant reduction in PA density and thus NaCl rejection, as evidenced by its unmeasurably high MWCO (Figure S6). Notably, no enhancement in the molecular density and salt rejection of the PA nanofilm was observed upon the SDS addition (Figure S6). This result provides important insights into the surfactant-regulated IP mechanism.Key: enhanced support wettability (Nano Lett. 2023,23,4822−4829)',\n",
       " '26\\\\Q: What is the Marangoni phenomenon in membrane fabrication?Context: Because IP is a complex process involving the simultaneous diffusion and reaction of various molecules, the nanofilm formed via IP is susceptible to interfacial instabilities via various mechanisms, possibly producing an irregular film  structure. Specifically, the spontaneous dissolution of highly surface-active TX-100 into n-hexane can create its concentration inhomogeneity and thus an interfacial tension gradient along the interface. This non-uniform interfacial tension drives liquid motion along the interface toward regions with higher interfacial tension, which sets the underlying liquid in motion, inducing a convective interfacial flow, called solutal  Marangoni convection. The interfacial turbulent flow induced by Marangoni instability presumably provoked the crumpling of the initially formed nascent PA layer while promoting the trans-interface migration of MPD monomers (Figure 3D and Figure S16B; see text in the Supporting  Information). The continuous MPD diffusion-reaction coupled with successive film crumpling likely resulted in a rough, thick, and multi-layered porous PA nanofilm. Although the heat released from the exothermic IP reaction  possibly drives Rayleigh−Benárd instability, this thermallydriven instability may not dominate the Marangoni effect due to the small Rayleigh number. Interfacial degassing may partially contribute to the interfacial instability, but its effect may also not be strong in our case. This is because generated nanobubbles can be effectively eliminated when PA nanofilms  are formed at the free interface.Key: This non-uniform interfacial tension drives liquid motion along the interface toward regions with higher interfacial tension.

Herein, we proposed a facile route, i.e., grafting the short chain amino-rich monomers (SCA, H(NHCH2CH2)1-4-NH2) instead of conventional amino-rich macro-monomers (ARM), to construct a separation layer with uniform positive  charge on the surface of pristine polyamide (PA) NF membrane to achieve effective Li+/Mg2+ separation. The SCA grafted NF membrane (PA-g-SCA) retained a more uniform distribution of positively charged groups on the PA layer compared with ARM grafted NF membrane. The SCA grafted NF membrane exhibited a high rejection of  Mg2+ and high permeation of Li + at the same time, leading to an extremely high separation factor for Li+/Mg2+ of 130 even in the WMg2+/Li+ of 200:1 in the feed, which greatly surpassed those reported. The pure water flux was 1.8 folds than that of the pristine NF membrane due to the hydrophilicity improvement. The results suggested that the distribution uniformity of positive charges could be the key to efficient Li+/Mg2+ separation of  the NF membrane.

To address the sustainability challenge associated with the fabrication of separation membranes, a paradigm shift from the use of petrochemical-based raw materials to greener biobased sources is highly desired. In this study, blends of cellulose — as a plant-based material — and chitosan — obtained from shrimp farming waste and used as a biomass material — were investigated for the fabrication of oil and solventresistant nanofiltration membranes. The structural, thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of the prepared membranes were characterized. Molecular simulations were performed to study the fractional free volume and interaction energy among membrane constituents. Adjusting the cellulose–chitosan ratio allowed fine-tuning the molecular sieving properties of the membranes, which exhibited outstanding separation performance and chemical stability even in harsh solvents, such as polar aprotic solvents, at the maximum temperature of 100 ◦C.

In particular, SARIP with CTAB undermines the selectivity of the PA active layer, resulting in larger and more heterogeneous pore size distribution (Table\\xa01, Supplementary Figs.\\xa019–22, Supplementary Tables\\xa011, 12). The repulsion between the positively charged CTAB and PIP increases the energy barrier for trans-interface PIP diffusion, consequently leading to slower and more heterogeneous transport of PIP and hence less uniform pore size distribution.Key:The energy barrier increased, leads to slower and more heterogeneous transport of PIP.

Nevertheless, the underlining mechanisms and the effects on membrane separation performance remain controversial. To dissect the exact role of pore properties, we synthesized TFC polyamide membranes on polycarbonate substrates with cylindrical track-etched pores (PCTE) of well-defined pore size ranging from 10 to 800 nm. Leaf-like roughness features were most prominent for polyamide films formed on substrates of intermediate pore sizes (80 and 100 nm). Smaller pores inhibited leaf-like features as a result of insufficient storage of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) monomers for the interfacial reaction, whereas larger pores resulted in diminished surface roughness due to the lack of confinement to the interfacially degassed nanobubbles. Substrate porosity plays a critical role on membrane water permeability, while smaller pores with greater pore density are favored to improve membrane rejection. TFC polyamide membranes prepared on sponge-like poly(ether sulfone) and polysulfone substrates exhibit better water permeability and salt rejection compared to the PCTE-TFC membranes thanks to the simultaneously enhanced confinement and MPD storage effects. The mechanistic insights gained in this study reveal the huge potential of substrate design toward high-performance TFC RO membranes.Key: Dissecting the Role of Substrate on the Morphology and Separation Properties of Thin Film Composite Polyamide Membranes: Seeing Is Believing (Environ.

       " '36\\\\Q: In the range of 80-200nm, how does the size of the bottom membrane pore size affect the surface morphology of the final RO membrane separation layer formed in the interfacial polymerization reaction?Context: TFC Membranes Formed on PCTE. Figure 1 presents the SEM micrographs of the PCTE substrates (top view) and the polyamide films (both top and bottom views). It is important to note that the actual pore size of PCTE-200 and PCTE-800 was approximately 70−90 nm larger than the respective nominal sizes provided by the manufacturer (Table 1). The nominal sizes of other PCTE substrates were reasonably accurate. The top surfaces of polyamide films show leaf-like roughness features whose presence was most obvious for TFC-80 and TFC-100. Increasing the substrate pore size from 100 to 800 nm led to the diminishing of these characteristic features. According to our recent works, the leaf-like features were formed due to the interfacial degassing of CO2 nanobubbles that are encapsulated between the polyamide film and the substrate. Increasing the pore size of the substrate would reduce the confinement effect by the substrate and allow the nanobubbles to escape through the large pores. In contrast to the common belief that leaves grow directly over pores, we observed smooth and flat polyamide films spanning over the pores of 80−200 nm (highlighted by the dotted circles in Figure 2). Indeed, the leaf-like features developed predominantly around the pores. Although these observations appear to be peculiar and counterintuitive, they are consistent with the interfacial degassing theory. Due to the release of heat and H+ during the IP reaction, the dissolved bicarbonate will be degassed (see ref 37 and Supporting Information S4). This degassing can possibly happen both inside the substrate pores and at the vicinity of the pores. The confinement effect by the solid matrix around the pores allows the CO2 nanobubbles to be retained, which shapes the leaf-like roughness features. However, the confinement effect was the weakest directly over the straight cylindrical pores, which prevents effective retention of degassed nanobubbles. Therefore, our study further confirms the critical importance of the substrate confinement effect in shaping the polyamide surface roughness. This confinement effect also explains why surface roughness could not effectively develop for polyamide films formed at free interfaces. With a further increase of substrate pore size to 800 nm, the polyamide intruded into the substrate due to a lack of effective support (see the bottom view of TFC-800 in Figure 1).Key: The non-porous part of the base film is impermeable and has a stronger restriction effect on nanobubbles, forming a distinct leaf-like structure. As the pore size of the base film increases, the restriction effect of the substrate is reduced and nanobubbles are allowed to escape through the macropores. When the pore size is further increased, internal permeation occurs. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2020,54(11),6978-6986)',\n",
       " '37\\\\Q: In the range of 10-80nm, how does the size of the bottom membrane pore size affect the surface morphology of the final RO membrane separation layer formed in the interfacial polymerization reaction, and why is it the opposite of the phenomenon of 80-200nm?Context: Interestingly, increasing the substrate pore size from 10 to 80 nm led to an opposite trend. While the roughness features were barely noticeable for TFC-10, they became increasingly larger for TFC-30, TFC-50, and TFC-80. This trend can possibly be rationalized by the greater storage of MPD (Supporting Information S4) and its enhanced diffusion withincreasing pore size. According to the interfacial degassing theory, increasing the effective concentration of MPD would cause greater production of heat at the reaction interface to promote the release of CO2 nanobubbles. Our observation is also consistent with some earlier studies reporting increased roughness formation for larger pores. Some of the earlier studies attributed the greater roughness to the enhanced “volcanic” eruption of MPD. However, this eruption model alone (which would predict the greatest roughness for TFC-800 as well as formation of roughness features directly over pores) cannot fully explain the surface morphology of the polyamide film. In the current study, we demonstrate that this surface morphology is governed by two competing mechanisms with larger pores leading to a reduced confinement effect (a roughness inhibitor) in addition to greater MPD storage (a roughness promoter)Key: As the pore size increases, the storage of MPD increases, thereby enhancing diffusion and leading to an increase in the roughness of the resulting separation layer.

       " '38\\\\Q: Why are substrates with sponge-like pores more suitable for interfacial polymerization?Context: Figure 4 presents the effect of substrate pore size, porosity, and pore density on the permeability and rejection of the TFC membranes. For the PCTE substrates, increasing substrate pore size had an obvious positive effect in increasing the TFC membrane permeability (Figure 4A). However, the membrane rejection can be seriously comprised for cylindrical pores of greater than 100 nm in size (Figure 4B), possibly due to the greater tendency to form more defects in the polyamide layer over large substrate pores.19 In addition, for the ultrathin and unsupported polyamide film that spans over the large cylindrical pores of PCTE substrates, it is mechanically unstable (e.g., the thin film is stretched due to the tensile stress in the longitudinal direction when the membrane is pressurized, causing a loss of membrane integrity). Compared to the PCTE counterparts, the corresponding PES and PSf substrates with comparable pore sizes showed better combinations of permeability and rejection, implying that substrates with sponge-like structures are preferred for interfacial polymerization. Notably, the much improved permeabilities of TFCPES1 and TFC-PSf (average substrate pore sizes of 16 ± 4 nm and 35 ± 12 nm, respectively) over their TFC-PCTE counterparts of similar pore size range (10−50 nm) can be explained by the substantially higher surface porosity for sponge-like substrates. Indeed, Figure 4C shows a much better correlation between permeability and porosity (R2 = 0.85), revealing substrate surface porosity as a more important.Key: The sponge-like substrate has a higher surface porosity.

Integrating a conventional flat two-dimensional (2D) membrane with structures of different dimensionalities is expected to create additional water transport sites. However, organizing the membrane building blocks into a mixed-dimensional hierarchy capable of facilitating rapid water transfer, while also enabling large-scale, cost-effective manufacturing, remains a significant challenge.

The resulting architecture with one-dimensional nanotubes on a 2D nanofilm offers a substantially increased available area for water transport per projected area, enabling energy-efficient nanofiltration membranes with outstanding water–salt separation performance that well surpasses most state of the art membranes. Control experiments, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveal that the two types of molecular monomers self-organize into a 2D nanopore network during the incipient reaction stage and then capillarity within these nanopores drives the upwards polymerization of these nanotubes. Our findings provide valuable insights into how the interplay of interfacial physical and chemical interactions organizes molecular seeds into large-scale, complex hierarchical nanostructures under ambient conditions.

       " '42\\\\Q: What is the primary mechanism driving the self-organization of the mixed-dimensional structure?Context: On the basis of these findings and structural characterizations, we propose a potential self-organization model for the interfacial synthesis of the NoN structure. In the incipient stage of the interfacial reaction, the initially formed oligomers tend to aggregate into nanopore network owing to the huge surface energy and scarcity of diamine in the reaction zone (further elaborated below with the assistance of simulations). The nanopores subsequently serve as growth sites for the polyamide nanotubes, as confirmed by the similar pore size of the back surface to the inner diameter of the nanotubes. Capillarity facilitates the transfer of the aqueous phase solution to the upper rims of the nanopores, resembling the upwards movement of sap in the xylem conduits of trees. The rapid reaction kinetics between organic amines and acyl chlorides (reaction constant ~102–105 l mol−1 s−1) promote the immediate nucleation and assembly of polyamide oligomers along the rims of nanopores when the aqueous and organic phase monomers come into contact. This leads to the growth of the nanotube walls. The newly formed walls of nanotubes then act as templates for the continuous growth of polyamide nanotubes, with the elevation of aqueous monomer solution in the nanotubes driving the growth process. To gain further insights into the assembly of the nanopore network at the incipient reaction stage and the capillary flow in the polyamide nanopores between the oil–water interface, MD simulations were performed.Key: Capillary-driven growth (Nature Water 2,1238–1248(2024)',\n",

Then, the residual droplets were immediately removed by air sweeping, and the soaked PVC support membrane was left to dry at room temperature for a specified duration. Subsequently, the membrane was submerged in an organic solution containing trimesoyl chloride (TMC), thereby initiating the interfacial reaction. Closely packed polyamide nanotubes with high uniformity and significant dimensions (up to several centimetres) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2) are obtained by carefully controlling the interplay between interfacial reactions and capillary-driven self-organization. This control involves adjusting the surface hydrophilicity of the support membrane and the air-drying time before the reaction. The formation mechanism of the mixed-dimensional surface structure will be discussed in the next section. Remarkably, similar NoN structures could be obtained across various oil phases including n-decane, n-hexane and cyclohexane, as well as different support membranes, such as polysulfone and  polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, indicating their reproducibility and generality (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).Key: Air-drying time, hydrophilicity of the support membrane, type of organic solvent (Nature Water 2,1238–1248(2024)',\n",

The MD simulation results (Fig. 3d,e, Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) indicated that the initially formed polyamide oligomers at the n-decane–water interface spontaneously organized into a nanopore network. In our simulations (Supplementary Fig. 12), the nanopore size increased from approximately 13.4 nm to 29.3 nm as the number of diamine molecules decreased from 3,750 to 2,250, while maintaining a molar ratio of PIP to TMC of 3:2. This suggests that a nanopore size of around 30 nm can be achieved, aligning with the dimensions observed on both the back surface and the inner diameter of the nanotubes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the existence of a nanoporous network in the incipient stages of interfacial polycondensation has been confirmed through simulation. We then constructed polyamide nanopore models with various pore sizes and depths to simulate the fluid flow within. MD simulations of nanoscale capillary flow (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Figs. 13–17 and Supplementary Videos 3–6) show that water molecules coupled with diamines can reach the upper rims of polyamide nanopores in just a few nanoseconds, even with increased nanopore height from 9.0 nm to 18.0 nm and pore size from 9.0 nm to 30.0 nm.Key: The formation of nanopore networks at the incipient reaction stage (Nature Water 2,1238–1248(2024)',\n",

However, achieving a thin and dense polyamide nanofilm with high permeance and selectivity is challenging when using a conventional substrate with uniform wettability. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of Janus porous substrates as confined interfacial reactors to decouple the local monomer concentration from the total monomer amount during interfacial polymerization. By manipulating the location of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface in a Janus porous substrate, we can precisely control the monomer solution confined within the hydrophilic layer without compromising its concentration. The hydrophilic surface ensures the uniform distribution of monomers, preventing the formation of defects. By employing Janus substrates fabricated through single-sided deposition of polydopamine/polyethyleneimine, we significantly reduce the thickness of the polyamide nanofilms from 88.4 to 3.8 nm by decreasing the thickness of the hydrophilic layer. This reduction leads to a remarkable enhancement in water permeance from 7.2 to 52.0 l/m2·h·bar while still maintaining ~96% Na2SO4 rejection. The overall performance of  this membrane surpasses that of most reported membranes, including state-of-the-art commercial products.

Include key materials and steps.Context: As mentioned above, the Janus substrate is facilely prepared via single-sided co-deposition of PDA/PEI on PPMM (Figs. S1 and S2). The thickness of the hydrophilic layer is tuned from 2.9 to 40.5 μm with an increased deposition period from 1 to 4 h (Fig.  2A to C and Fig. S3). With the increasing thickness of hydrophilic layer, the absorption capacity of the aqueous diamine solution is adjusted from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 6.57 ± 0.15 mg/cm2 (Fig.  S4). On the other hand, the initial water contact angle of the deposited surface is reduced below 50° after more than 1 h of deposition, leading to the uniform distribution of the aqueous solution of diamine molecules (Fig. S5). Moreover, no obvious change was observed from the surface morphology of the porous substrate after 4 h of deposition, indicating that the PDA/PEI layer would not affect the substrate permeance (Fig. S1).Key: The Janus substrate was prepared by single-sided co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) on a polypropylene microfiltration membrane (PPMM).

       " '48\\\\Q: How should I use the monomer if I want to prepare a thin and uniform film?Context: The nanofiltration performance of our polyamide composite membranes was evaluated by a cross-flow filtration apparatus. The effects of diamine monomer amount and concentration on the membrane performance were investigated thoroughly (Fig. S11). The polyamide composite membranes fabricated by piperazine with a common concentration of 34.8 mM and limited total amount show both high water permeance and Na2SO4  rejection, which is superior to those membranes by the same total monomer amount but lower concentration, or the same concentration but higher total amount (Figs. S11 and S12). The differences in membrane performance stem from the structures of polyamide nanofilms formed under varying reaction conditions. A high concentration and limited amount of piperazine facilitate the formation of ultrathin and integral polyamide nanofilms. In contrast, both a high concentration and amount of piperazine yield dense but thick nanofilms, while a low concentration and limited amount of piperazine result in thin but defective nanofilms. (Fig. 3D and Fig. S13). These results indicate that confining the aqueous solution of amine monomer reserved within the substrates is a more effective way to improve the nanofilm performance than adjusting the diamine concentration. In addition, this confined “interfacial reactor” has the potential to be applied in practical manufacturing because the concentration used in this work has been widely used in industry.Key: A high concentration and limited amount of aqueous monomer.

       " '49\\\\Q: How does the Janus substrate enable high local monomer concentration while limiting the total monomer amount?Context: Interfacial polymerization of piperazine and trimesoyl chloride was conducted on the hydrophilic side of Janus substrates at common monomer concentrations used extensively in industry. The polyamide nanofilm thickness is handily adjusted by the thickness of hydrophilic layers to tune the absorption of diamine solution within substrates (Fig. 2D to G and Fig. S6). The piperazine reserved within the Janus substrate declined from 228.7 to 25.4 nmol/cm2 with the same piperazine concentration of 34.8 mM when the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreased from 40.5 to 15.7 μm. Meanwhile, the nanofilm thickness is dramatically reduced from 88.4 to 3.8 nm as the thickness of hydrophilic layers decreases. It is worth noting the polyamide nanofilm with a thickness of 3.8 nm is one of the thinnest polyamide nanofilms as reported in the literature. This result demonstrates that Janus substrates provide an accessible, alternative, and novel “interfacial reactor” to effectively regulate the polyamide nanofilm thickness. Moreover, the hydrophobic layer can prevent the penetration of the aqueous solution into the substrate, especially for the large-pore substrates. The effect of the total piperazine amount on nanofilm morphology was observed by SEM. No polyamide nanofilm is formed on the nascent PPMM substrate because the diamine solution cannot be spread on the hydrophobic surface (Fig. S7). The porous surface was gradually covered by polyamide nanofilms synthesized by an increased diamine amount. The critical amount of piperazine to fabricate an integral polyamide nanofilm  on Janus substrate is 25.4 ± 2.3 nmol/cm2, which is only about one-ninth of the diamine usage on a conventional hydrophilic substrate.Key: The hydrophilic layer maintain a high concentration at the reaction interface.

Herein, high-performance seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes were developed by integrating E. colibased or tannic acid (TA)-encapsulated liposomes, using either conventional blending or spray-assisted strategies with optimized nanovesicle utilization. The uniform nanovesicle dispersion on substrate surfaces and the regulated interfacial polymerization process significantly enhanced the membrane properties. Liposomeintegrated membranes, such as the BM-Conv and BM-Spray membranes prepared via conventional blending and spray-assisted pre-deposition strategies, respectively, exhibited enlarged nanovoid size and increased rear surface porosity beneath the protuberant PA layer. These changes, along with an enlarged surface area, improved wettability, and reduced cross-linking degree, resulted in a notable 47.1–58.8 % improvement in water permeance, reaching 2.5–2.7 L m 2 h 1 bar 1, while exhibiting a slight reduction in salt rejection (99.05–99.13 %) compared to the nanovesicles-free control membrane. Notably, the feasible spray-assisted technique achieved comparable separation performance while using just 3.8 % of the liposome quantity required in the conventional blending approach, significantly reducing additive consumption. Additionally, the TA@BM-spray membrane, integrating TA-coated liposomes, exhibited the enhanced cross-linking degree and wettability, while maintaining similar microstructural morphology and surface properties to other liposomes-integrated membranes, suggesting reinforced interfacial compatibility between the liposomes and the PA layer attributed to the multiple interactions bridged by TA with reactive monomer. This led to a 29.4 % improvement in water permeance,  reaching 2.2 L m 2 h 1 bar 1, and enhanced salt rejection to 99.45 %. This study elucidates the underlying mechanisms by which nanovesicles play the pivotal roles in tailoring physiochemical properties of the PA layer, offering a viable strategy for designing nanovesicles-integrated TFC SWRO membranes with enhanced desalination performance.Key: Synergetic effects of spray-assisted nanovesicle integration and interfacial compatibility strategy for enhanced bioinspired seawater desalination membrane (Journal of Membrane Science 718(2025)123703)',\n",

In this study, we demonstrated that thin polyamide layer can be synthesized directly on microfiltration ceramic tubular membranes with a surface pore size of 0.1–0.2 μm via interfacial polymerization without an intermediate layer. A thin polyamide layer with a thickness 30–40 nm was coated on the inner surface of the ceramic substrate by circulating the monomers of branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), piperazine (PIP), and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) through the membrane lumen. The thin film layer showed good integration with the ceramic substrate and could withstand high pressure of at least 10 bar. The mechanical property of the polyamide layer was examined using AFM and the modulus was measured. The thin film composite membranes demonstrated excellent nanofiltration performance with a pure water permeability of 16–18 LMH bar−1 and a molecular weight cut-off of ∼250 Da.

What role did PIP play in the polyamide network formation?Context: The PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. The MWCO of the polyamide composite ceramic membranes was tested with PEGs and diethylene glycol, and both of the membranes PA100 and PA-200 had a similar MWCO of 240–260 Da, as shown in Fig. 9. The membrane MWCO was smaller than most of the PEI-based polyamide membranes on hollow fibre or tubular membrane substrates [19,29,43]. Pure PEI-based polyamide membranes usually have MWCO between 350 and 500 Da and the addition of PIP in this study has shown effective in reducing the MWCO of the membranes without reducing the flux significantly. The PEG rejection of PA-200 was slightly lower than PA-100, which could be due to minor defects in the polyamide layer. The membrane PA-100 was also tested for sugar and dye rejections. The rejections of raffinose (504 g/mol), sucrose (342 g/mol) and glucose (180 g/mol) were 99.1, 98.9 and 87.4%, respectively, and the rejections of rose bagel (875 g/mol), acid fuschin (586 g/mol) and methyl orange (327 g/mol) were 99.2, 99.9 and 99.0%, respectively.

In this study, an antifouling low-pressure NF membrane was designed and fabricated via rapid co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI) on electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled polyethersulfone (PES) flat sheet membrane followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The optimized resultant membrane (LBL-cPP) presented approximately 11 LMH/bar pure water permeability with more than 90% rejection divalent cations under 2 bar pressure.

The obtained casting solution was degassed overnight. A casting knife was used to spread the casting solution onto a non-woven support sustained by a clean glass plate at a gate height of 120 μm. Subsequently, the plate was immersed into a coagulant bath containing tap water for phase inversion at room temperature. The nascent PES substrate was kept in DI water for subsequent LBL deposition. The PES substrate was modified with LBL deposition procedures as reported in previous study [17]. In brief, the freshly prepared PSS solution (50 mL, 4 g/L with 30 g/L NaCl, original pH) was first poured into a customized membrane holder (effective modification area of  72 cm2) where only the active layer of the PES substrate was exposed to the polyanion solution for 15 min. After rinsing with DI water, the surface of anionic polyelectrolyte-loaded substrate was contacted with PAH solution (50 mL, 10 g/L with 150 g/L NaCl at a pH 2.3) for 10 min, followed by another DI water rinsing. The multiple PSS/PAH bilayers were prepared by repeating the steps described above (10 min for each deposition). In the current work, NF membrane with 2.5 PSS/PAH bilayers were fabricated, which was denoted as LBL.

Zeta potential and surface charge density are semi-quantitatively related based on the double layer theory. Conversion between the two parameters for membranes requires questionable simplification assumptions. The zeta potential provides the electrokinetic potential — the potential at the electrokinetic plane of shear — not the fixed charged density of the membrane, which can lead to erroneous conclusions about the membrane charge characteristics. For example, the measured zeta potential can be negative for neutrally charged membranes, such as cellulose acetate, likely owing to adsorption of anions to the membrane. Quantifying the charge density is more useful than the zeta potential for mechanistic studies of how membrane charge affects salt transport. Zeta potential, however, can be used for semi-quantitative analyses, such as determining the iso-electric point of the membrane90,106, or assessing the impacts of surface modification on the electrokinetic properties of the membrane.Key: Zeta potential reflects electrokinetic potential, while surface charge density quantifies fixed charges.

Highlight their applications and limitations.Context: Three types of microscopic techniques are commonly used to characterize the morphology of TFC-PA membranes: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). When performing high-resolution SEM, a conductive coating, for instance, gold or palladium, is used to improve membrane visibility to provide direct visualization of the surface (top view) and cross-sectional morphology. For example, TFC-PA membranes made using MPD amine monomers for SWRO were observed to have a ridge-and-valley morphology for the PA layer. By contrast, membranes fabricated using PIP amine monomers for NF typically have nodular morphology. Other interesting morphologies, such as stripes, craters and 2D fractals, can also emerge with interfacial polymerization processes that are modified with additives or post-treatment. Usually, TEM is used to image membrane cross-sections to evaluate PA layer thickness and to identify voids in the PA layer by distinguishing different parts — PA layer, polysulfone or polyethersulfone support, and voids — on the basis of their different electron transmittance values. Staining the PA layer with heavy metals increases the electron contrast between the PA layer and polysulfone or polyethersulfone support, enabling the interface to be more clearly discerned68. Alternatively, the interface can be identified using elemental mapping on the basis of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). With metal staining or elemental mapping, the cross-sectional TEM micrographs provide a clear distinction between the PA and microporous support layer.Key: SEM visualizes surface morphology with conductive coatings but lacks depth information.

The continuous MPD diffusion-reaction coupled with successive film crumpling likely resulted in a rough, thick, and multi-layered porous PA nanofilm.

The sulfur atoms (S) in the Orange II dye were used as tracer atoms. The sample preparation for EDS determination on FETEM was shown in Scheme 2. Briefly, the NF membrane was firstly immersed into 0.5 mmol/L Orange II dye aqueous solution (pH = 3) for full complex of amino groups with positive charge on the surface of obtained NF membranes with the negatively charged Orange II dye under stirring for 6 h at 25 ℃. Subsequently, the membrane surface was rinsed and sonicated repeatedly at least 3 times with 1 mmol/L HCl to remove the unabsorbed dye thoroughly. In order to characterize the positive charge distribution as accurately as possible, the support of NF membrane was completely dissolved and cleaned by DMAc to obtain an independent PA separation layer with a thickness thin than 200 nm. Then, the PA layer can be penetrated by electron beams of TEM with a 200 kV accelerating voltage to improve the resolution of EDS mapping. Finally, it was loaded and dried on a copper grid to be characterized by EDS. The K-nearest neighbor method was employed to quantify the density and uniformity of element distribution points (S, or N atoms) in EDS mapping images. For any target point, K-nearest neighbor points to the target point were found; and the average distance between these neighbor points and the target point was counted. The above steps were repeated for all S element points in the mapping image. The total average distance and the standard deviation of the average distance were calculated. The total average distance, corresponding to the total points per unit area, can characterize the density of the S element points.

In this state, the reaction rates and concentration ratios of the two monomers are appropriate, enabling the formation of a stable polymer structure. Under the condition of stoichiometric equilibrium, it is conducive to the formation of a narrow network pore structure and inhibits the formation of larger aggregate pores.

As shown in Fig. 2h, the apexes of some nanotubes were successfully cut off, revealing their inner cavities. The lateral cross-sectional morphology shown in Fig. 2i indicates that the central lumens of nanotubes are connected to the porous substrate, allowing for the determination of the inner diameter and wall thickness of the nanotubes. Specifically, the inner diameter is ~30 nm, and the wall thickness is ~60 nm, which is slightly thinner than the thickness of the nanofilm underneath  (~80 nm). These data regarding the inner diameter and wall thickness exhibited a high degree of consistency with the previously presented nanotube outer diameter data (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the SEM image viewed from the back surface of the NoN structure displayed a porous surface with an average pore size of ~34 nm (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 7), statistically similar to the inner diameter of most nanotubes. Projected area (Fig. 2k,i) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2m) micrographs of the NoN surface further verified the hollow structure of the nanotubes. As highlighted by the dashed red rectangle in Fig. 2m, the central lumen of the nanotube penetrates across the underneath nanofilm and connects to the porous substrate.

       " '50\\\\Q: What is the primary limitation of the Degree of Network Crosslinking (DNC) parameter in characterizing polyamide membranes?Context: The degree of network crosslinking (DNC) is a commonly used structural parameter to depict the polyamide networks formed by trifunctional and bifunctional monomers. The polyamide networks are typically categorized into crosslinking structures and linear structures, wherein the proportion of crosslinking structure is defined as DNC12. Representing the branching degree of polyamide, DNC provides a qualitative depiction of the compactness of polyamide networks. However, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a reliable and consistent correlation between DNC and water permeance or salt rejection in recent desalination researches. This primarily stems from the oversight of the significant number of terminal groups introduced by the emerging regulated methods of interface polymerization. These methods, such as free interfacial polymerization, interlayer construction, control agent addition, and reactive monomer spraying, inhibit the diffusion of amine monomers and accelerate the hydrolysis of TMC, resulting in large residue of carboxyl groups in the polyamide network. On the other hand, conducting interfacial polymerization at low temperatures introduces amino groups into the polyamide network, as evidenced by the positive charge on one side of the polyamide membrane. These terminal groups significantly influence the  ionization behavior and electrical properties of polyamide, ultimately affecting the rejection of high-valence ions. Regrettably, these terminal groups were ignored in the calculation process of DNC, resulting in abnormal DNC values below 0% or exceeding 100%. Moreover, the calculation of DNC usually relies on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, which employs the charge shift of the full spectrum, theoretical binding energy (BE), and peak fitting primarily based on the 1s peak of adventitious carbon. This approach, however, is not ideally compatible with carbon-based organic polymer materials with complex chemical environments, which further undermines the credibility of DNC as a reliable parameter for characterizing polyamide networks. On the one hand, the chemical environment of C in polyamide is complex, and the peaks in XPS are very wide. The highest position of C peak is usually the superposition of the peak positions of skeleton C and oxygencontaining C, which is difficult to confirm as the C 1 s BE commonly used for calibration (284.8-285.0 eV). On the other hand, XPS is difficult to avoid the interference of exogenous C, which has a wide range due to its poor electrical contact with the sample and will interfere with the peak shape of C. It is challenging to determine the extent to which the C 1 s spectrum is affected by the presence of adventitious carbon. Therefore, conducting charge shift with C is likely to result in the peak of N and O not appearing in the theoretical BE. In this case, it is easy to obtain inaccurate peak fitting results by directly using the theoretical peak position for peak fitting.Key: It neglects terminal carboxyl and amino groups.

This revealed that more GA molecules reacted with PEI resulting in that more hydroxyl groups of gallic acid (GA) were successfully introduced onto the HPAN NF membrane surface and endowed the membrane with good hydrophilicity. In contrast, if increasing PEI concentration from 1 wt% to 2 wt% at fixed GA concentration of 0.1 wt % in coating solution, the contact angle increased from 50.2° to 75.7° owing to that PEI molecules had many hydrophobic vinyl groups. As a result, both hydroxyl group of GA and hydrophobic vinyl groups of PEI  dominated the contact angle of the prepared HPAN NF membrane.Key: Increases due to hydrophobic vinyl groups (Journal of Membrane Science 524(2017)214–224)\",\n",

With high porosity and water permeability, the microfiltration substrates will contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the thin film composite membranes. Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of the cross-section of the tubular membranes. The membranes used in this study had an average inner and outer diameter of 3 and 5 mm, respectively. Fig. 1b is the cross-sectional image near the inner surface of the substrate. It can be seen that the substrate consists of two layers: a support layer with large ceramic particles that provides strong mechanical properties, and a surface layer with smaller particles that provides a smoother surface and a more homogeneous pore size. The ceramic membranes with two pore sizes, 100 and 200 nm (denoted as S-100 and S-200) were used in this study and both substrates had a fairly sharp pore size distribution (Fig. 1c). The mean pore sizes of the substrates S-100 and S-200 were 127 and 195 nm, respectively. The substrates had much larger pore sizes compared to the ceramic substrates used in previous studies for polyamide thin film synthesis.

The decline in permeability was observed for all NF membranes, which could be attributed to the 1) deposition of predominantly rejected inorganic ions and organic molecules on the membrane surface and the 2) formation of cake/biofilm layer originated from the build-up of colloidal particles, soluble microbial products and microorganisms. The periodical cleaning of NF membranes was performed when the permeability dropped to 80% of the initial flux. As seen in Fig. 8, the flux of NF 270 dropped almost linearly from the starting point and required the most frequent cleaning among all membranes. In addition, the flux was not able to recover after each cleaning process indicating irreversible fouling on the membrane surface. For the cLBL membrane, the interval between each cleaning cycle was extended, indicating lower fouling rate and better antifouling ability. As mentioned above, LBL deposition ameliorated the hydrophilicity of the resultant NF membrane, which effectively maximized  the surface hydration and alleviated the foulants adsorption. Hence, the membrane was more easily recovered after regular physical cleaning.Key: LBL-cPP membranes. PDA/PEI coating on the LBL layer enhanced antifouling property.

The impact of applied pressure on the water \\ue104ux and Na2SO4 was \\ue103rstly investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the water \\ue104uxes improve  proportionally with increasing the pressure from 2 bar to 8 bar but tend to level off at higher pressures while the rejection of Na2SO4 reduced due to concentration polarization. More speci\\ue103cally, TFC membranes synthesized by using PIP concentrations of 0.0175 wt% and 0.015 wt% have an ultrahigh water \\ue104ux of 211.2 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 52.8 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) and 251.6 L m 2 h 1 (permeability, 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1) under 4 bar, respectively, while maintaining a satisfactorily high rejection of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4. Such a high permeability is expected to originate from the reduced thickness of the thin selective PA layer, improved negative charges, and defect-free thin PA layer resulting from the homogeneous interfacial polymerization at the perfect interface between hexane and the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel, which will be fully discussed in the following section. The desalination performance of these two hydrogel-TFC membranes was compared with other membranes reported in 28 top cited published papers in the last 3 years in Fig. 2b. The comparison graph suggests that the performance of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is, to a large extent, superior to all other membranes (Table S5†). Such a high performance has the potential to further reduce the energy demand of the current desalination process from the perspective of the membrane.4 It is also noted that the hydrogel based TFC membrane can even maintain a good Na2SO4 rejection under 8 bar although the \\ue103brous hydrogel has a weak tensile strength of 0.185 0.021 MPa (Fig. S5†), which is mainly due to the strong interaction between the thin selective PA layer and the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel. The rejection of four salts (Na2SO4, MgSO4, MgCl2, and NaCl) was measured. The hydrogel-TFC membranes have a much higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 than MgCl2 and NaCl (Fig. 2c) due to the relatively larger size of the sulfate ions compared with the other three ions. Besides, hydrogel-TFC membranes are negatively charged which also contribute to the higher rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 due to the Donnan effect. With the decrease of PIP concentration from 0.04 wt% to 0.01 wt%, a sharp reduction in the rejection of Na2SO4 and MgSO4 is observed.Key: Negative. (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2020,8,3238)',\n",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to calculate the diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the free water and in the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel (Fig. 4a and b). The diffusion coefficients of the PIP molecules can be estimated from the slope of the mean square displacement (MSD) curves in Fig. 4c by the Einstein relationship.35 The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in water (6.0 10 10 m2 s 1) agrees well with the experimental results (6.07 10 10 m2 s 1 at 1.46 mol L 1, 298.15 K) in aqueous solution, which con\\ue103rms the accuracy of our MD simulations. The diffusion rate of PIP monomers in the hydrogel is 4.3 10 10 m2 s 1, 28.3% lower than that in the water, con\\ue103rming our hypothesis in the explanation of the ultrahigh water permeability of hydrogel-TFC membranes in the previous section. The relatively low PIP diffusion rate in the nano\\ue103brous Kevlar hydrogel is mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PIP monomers and the Kevlar networks; this also affects the interfacial polymerization. Therefore, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations were carried out to investigate the interfacial polymerization on the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel. The snapshots of the initial simulation system before the interfacial polymerization process, as well as the equilibrium state of the system a\\ue09der the interfacial polymerization process are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, PIP monomers are well dispersed in water and the hydrogel before interfacial polymerization.

In addition, compared to the thin selective layer in Fig. 5b, the active layer formed in the hydrogel system is thought to be thinner than that in the water system, due to the strong interaction between PIP and the Kevlar network.Key: MD simulations quantified a 28.3% reduction in PIP diffusion rate in the hydrogel compared to water, attributed to hydrogen bonding with Kevlar chains.

The Stokes  radius of BSA, 3.5 nm,55 is larger than the pore diameter of the copolymer membranes developed here, 3.4 ± 0.4 nm. As such, pore blockage and the formation of a cake layer on the top surface of the membrane are expected to be the primary mechanisms of fouling. These mechanisms will be driven by the attractive interactions between the foulants and the surface of the membrane. For the charge-functionalized membranes discussed here, the electrostatic interactions between BSA dissolved in solution and the membrane surface are critical to determining the magnitude of these interactions. One method for modulating these interactions is to examine the fouling profiles for solutions of varying pH. In particular, BSA has an  isoelectric point at pH 4.7−4.9.56 At this pH value, the protein has an equal balance of positive and negative charges, such that it is overall neutral. Below and above this pH value, the BSA  molecules are positively and negatively charged, respectively. Based on this prior characterization, 0.5 g L−1 BSA, 1 mM NaCl solutions adjusted to pH 3 or pH 4.7 were used for the initial series of fouling experiments. The pH 3 solution was chosen to maximize the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged foulant and the negatively charged membranes.

Specifically, we systematically evaluated the zeta potential of the membrane under different conditions of pH, salinity, and ionic composition, and correlated the obtained data with membrane performance tested under similar conditions. Our results identify the pKa of both carboxylic and amine groups bonded to the membrane surface and suggest that the highly polarizable chloride anions in the solution adsorb to the polyamide, increasing its negative charge. We also show that monovalent cations of different “stickiness” can neutralize the negative membrane charge to different extents due to their varying tendency to sorb to the polymer matrix or screen the fixed carboxyl groups on the membrane surface.

Our results imply that the membrane-solution interactions are ion-specific, where “stickier” weakly hydrated ions (e.g., Cs+) can more easily shed their hydration shell to attach to the membrane backbone and affect its charge, compared to less “sticky” strongly hydrated ions (e.g., Li+). Additionally, we show that chlorides, which have greater polarizability than the investigated cations, can adsorb to uncharged membrane segments, enhancing the Donnan exclusion of solution anions. Overall, our work clarifies existing discrepancies in ZP studies and demonstrates the contribution of adsorbed solution ions to the charge and performance of NF membranes by correlating between ZP, the ionization behavior of the fixed groups, and ion rejection and permeability.Key: Ions with lower hydration enthalpy and higher polarizability (npj Clean Water (2024)7:25)',\n",
       " '37\\\\Q: What does the following context mainly explain?Context: Our results show a clear inverse correlation between the parameters; that is, salt permeability is reduced with the increase in |ζ|, which implies that ZP is a reasonable indicator for Donnan exclusion. For instance, at pH 4.0 and I = 1 mM, the |ζ| is relatively low due to weak membrane charge with the accompanying reduced Donnan effects, which results in relatively high ion permeability (Fig. 4b). At pH 7.5 and high ionic strength, the |ζ| is greater and consequently ion permeability is reduced. The main reason for the lower permeability under these conditions is schematically explained in Fig. 4c, showing higher membrane charge, which is partly neutralized by the ions. At pH 7.5 and low ionic strength (Fig. 4d), there is limited charge screening, therefore many membrane charges generate strong Donnan effects resulting in very low permeability. The ZP results may also imply subtle differences in Donnan exclusion experienced by Li+ and Cs+, as reflected by the good correlation between the ratios of LiCl and CsCl ζ (rζ 1⁄4 ζLiCl=ζCsCl) and Ps (rP 1⁄4 PsðLiClÞ=PsðCsClÞ). Notably, the largest rζ was obtained at pH 7.5 and 1 mM, where the negative membrane charge is high (Fig. 1a, c) and charge screening is minor (Fig. 4d), leading to noticeable differences in Cs+ and Li+ permeabilities (rP = 0.74). It is stressed that we tested the match between ZP and Donnan exclusion only for pH ≤ 7.5, where the fixed membrane charge is solely influenced by protonation of carboxyl groups (Eq. (1)), while the amine groups are positively charged throughout the pH range. Thus, in the tested conditions, ZP is directly related to the overall number of charged fixed groups. On the other hand, at pH > 7.5, the increase in |ζ| with pH is the outcome of the protonation of  charged amine groups (i.e., Eq. (2)), resulting in a decrease in overall number of charged groups, but an increase in the overall negative charge. Lastly, we considered the potential effect of the carbonate system and water ions on the pH near the membrane wall. Based on the pKa values, the concentrations of the various species (Supplementary Table 3), and the expected permeability of the species, we computed the potential effect on the pH (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 2).

However, the improvement in the rejection profiles achieved using tighter membranes with a higher chitosan content comes at a cost of decreased permeance. For instance, the M25/75 membrane, which is denser than the other membranes, has less fractional free volume (Fig. 5), corresponding to higher resistance to solvent transport and thus reduced permeance.

Here, the ultraselective and yet highly water permeable polyamide nanofilm composite nanofiltration membranes developed by precisely controlling the kinetics of the interfacial polymerization reaction by maintaining the stoichiometric equilibrium at the interface is reported.

By measuring the time difference (such as the time difference dT between the reflected waves of different interfaces) and combining it with the propagation speed C of ultrasonic waves in the medium, the thickness change dS of the fouling layer can be determined using the formula dS = 0.5C×dT, thus achieving real - time monitoring of membrane fouling.Key: The reflection characteristics of ultrasonic wave are different when it propagates in different media.

       " '46\\\\Q: How does the presence of terminal carboxyl and amino groups affect the performance of polyamide membranes?Context: In contrast, when HABD is used to describe the crosslinked networks of polyamide, we observe a clear correlation between HABD and the performance of reverse osmosis polyamide membranes. Fig. 3C illustrates an overall improvement of NaCl rejection with the increase of HABD. The Spearman correlation coefficient for this relationship is 0.649, much larger than that of DNC. This indicates a strong positive correlation between HABD and NaCl rejection. Likewise, a discernible trend of decreasing water permeance and NaCl permeability coefficient is visible with the increase of HABD (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10). Thanks to the comprehensive analysis of the polyamide structure, the calculated HABD consistently holds physical significance regardless of the proportion of terminal groups. The increase of terminal groups only decreases the value of HABD but will not cause it to become negative. This ensures that HABD can work for loose polyamides with rich terminal groups. Furthermore, HABD more accurately describes the correlations between crosslinked networks and performance. The closer the value of HABD is to 9.3 mmol g-1, the fewer carboxyl and amino groups are present in polyamide, indicating a higher conversion to amide bonds during interfacial polymerization. Crosslinked polyamide membranes with higher HABD thus exhibit  reduced free volume and pore size resulting in higher NaCl rejection and lower water permeance. Our analysis then extends to PIP-TMC type nanofiltration membranes. In this case, the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance becomes more challenging due to the contribution of both pore size and charge properties of polyamide membranes. A denser network provides a higher blocking ability to salt ions owing to the size exclusion effect, while the presence of abundant charge on the membrane surface can also block high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect. Most PIP-TMC polyamide membranes possess a substantial number of hydrolyzed TMC terminal structures and exhibit negative charges, exacerbating the difficulty to establish the correlation between crosslinked networks and nanofiltration performance. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the structure of PIP-TMC polyamide to gain a better understanding of its nanofiltration behavior.Key: This enhances water permeance but may decrease salt rejection unless compensated by charge effects.

       " '47\\\\Q: What structural parameter is used in HABD calculation to account for carboxyl and amino groups? How does the MgCl2 rejection change as the carboxyl density increase?Context: As the amide bond density decreases and the number of terminal groups increases in the crosslinked network, PIP-TMC polyamide membrane exhibits higher water permeance. This is expected because a more loosely crosslinked polyamide network with increased terminal groups provides larger voids and facilitates the transport of water molecules. However, the change in Na2SO4 rejection is not significantly affected by the variation in HABD. This observation can be explained by the presence of rich charges on the membrane surface, which blocks high-valent salt ions through the Donnan effect as mentioned. To quantify terminal groups and analyze their ionization behavior, we have introduced two analogous parameters, namely the harmonic carboxyl density (HCD) and the harmonic amino density (HAD). These parameters, reflecting the contents of carboxyl and amino groups per mass of polyamide, are essential in accurately representing the surface charge of polyamides (Section 4 in Supplementary Information). It was demonstrated that PIP-TMC polyamide with higher HCD exhibits a stronger negative charge and higher Na2SO4 rejection (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). This finding strongly supports the notion that incorporating strong negative charges is effective in rejecting divalent anions when designing nanofiltration membranes. Nonetheless, the rejection of nanofiltration membranes is contributed by two factors: the screening of pores brought by polyamide networks and the Donnan effect of surface charge. Therefore, it is challenging to establish reliable structure-activity relationships by isolating these two factors. We recommend the comprehensive use of our proposed structural parameters − HABD and HCD. Our method offers a possibility to comprehensively analyze the rejection of nanofiltration, by providing information on HABD for the compactness of crosslinked polyamide networks, as well as HCD and HAD for the charge density of the polyamide nanofilms. These structure parameters can be crossreferenced with other characterization methods, providing a valuable tool for analyzing polyamides.Key: Harmonic carboxyl density (HCD) and the harmonic amino density (HAD).

       " \"49\\\\Q: How does the surface charge of the polyamide nanofilm affect salt rejection?Context: Figure 4B illustrates the salt rejection capacity of the polyamide composite membranes (Fig. S14). On the one hand, the membranes show higher rejection to divalent anions (i.e., SO42−)  than monovalent anions (i.e., Cl−). Typically, the rejection to Na2SO4 is 95.6% and 96.6% for the membranes with polyamide  nanofilms of 3.8 and 5.8 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the negatively charged surface contributes to the better rejection to divalent anions than divalent cations [44]. As a result, the salt rejection performance of membranes exhibits a sequence of Na2SO4 > MgSO4 > MgCl2 > CaCl2 > NaCl. Interestingly,  the rejection to Na2SO4 (>95.6%) is much higher than that to NaCl (<34.0%) owing to the stronger electrostatic repulsion  and the larger hydrated ion radius of SO2−  4 (0.38 nm) in contrast  to Cl− (0.33 nm) [45], demonstrating excellent separation ratio between monovalent and divalent ions. The NaCl/Na2SO4 selectivity reaches 21.0 and 23.6 for the composite membranes with nanofilms of 3.8 and 5.8 nm (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a relatively high rejection to Na2SO4 (>90%) can be maintained under a  wide range of operating pressure from 2 to 8 bar (Fig. S15). On the one hand, the polyamide composite membranes exhibit  excellent water permeance of about 50 l/m2·h·bar and high Na2SO4 rejection of about 95% under a low pressure of 2 bar,  indicating their great potential in low-pressure nanofiltration. On the other hand, the membranes show decent separation  performance with a high Na2SO4 rejection of above 90% even  under high pressure of 8 bar, demonstrating their good mechanical strength during nanofiltration. The robust structure can be ascribed to the high Young's modulus of polyamide nanofilms and the high binding strength between the nanofilm and substrate.Key: The negatively charged surface repels divalent anions more effectively than monovalent ions, leading to higher rejection of Na2SO4.

       " '50\\\\Q: What was the optimal cross-linking temperature for the prepared loose NF membrane?Context: The chemistry property of the thin selective layer and its preparation condition had a decisive effect on separation performance of prepared composite NF membrane [37,38]. Firstly, the cross-linking temperature was studied at fixed concentration for gallic acid (0.1 wt%) and PEI (1 wt%) in coating solutions and cross-linking time of 30 min and the corresponding results were given in the Fig. 8. The permeate fluxes were sharply decreased from 50 L/m2·h to 10 L/m2·h (for Gongo red) and from 45 L/m2·h to 9.2 L/m2·h (for Methyl blue) while rejection ratios of Gongo red and Methyl blue increased slightly. This proved that skin layer formed by coating modified PEI became denser with increasing the temperature from 45 °C to 75 °C. Therefore, the cross-linking temperature was an important factor influening on  separation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane. Fig. 9(a) presented the effect of gallic acid concentration on the permeation performance of the prepared loose NF membrane at fixed 1 wt% PEI concentration in coating solution under TMP of 0.2 MPa and cross-linking temperature of 45 °C. For 0.1 wt% gallic acid, membrane permeate flux reached up to 51 L/m2· h. However, the further increasing gallic acid concentration from 0.1 wt% to 0.3 wt % would cause the decline in permeate flux, which was decresed from 51 L/m2·h to 29 L/m2·h. This could be explained by sheets polymers surface morphology (Fig. 7). The additon of small amount gallic acid in coating solution could make the selective layer become relatively loose and enhanced membrane permeate flux. Meanwhile, the similar variation trend of permeate flux was also observed with increased PEI concentration at fixed GA concentration of 0.1 wt% in coating solution. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the membrane permeate flux decreased from 51 L/m2·h to 24.5 L/m2·h owing to the fact that the skin layer became denser with increasing PEI concentration and the hydrophlicity of the membrane decreased with increasing PEI concentration.Key: 45 ℃ (Journal of Membrane Science 524(2017)214–224)',\n",
       " '51\\\\Q: What is the advantage of using ceramic substrates over polymeric substrates for nanofiltration membranes?Context: The pinpoint technique on AFM was used to determine the elastic modulus of the polyamide membranes on the ceramic substrates. Fig. 6a and b shows the moduli of the membranes measured across the scan area. The patterns look different compared to the topography images shown in the previous section (Fig. 3b and d). Especially for PA200, the area with high moduli is very distinct from the area with low moduli. The mean moduli obtained were 5.11 and 3.95 GPa for membrane PA-100 and PA-200, respectively, and these values were higher than the modulus of commercial polyamide nylon [39]. The moduli were also higher than that measured using the wrinkling-cracking method, where one of the highest modulus values measured was only 2.71 GPa [16]. The high moduli measured in this study could be contributed by the ceramic substrates underneath the polyamide layer, and further analysis on the measured data was required to determine the real modulus of the polyamide layer. The PWP of the ceramic substrates and the polyamide composite membranes were tested in a cross-flow mode. The substrates S-100 and S-200 had a PWP of 589 ± 23 and 1069 ± 27 LMH bar−1, respectively. The PWP of the substrates were moderately high compared to some ceramic membranes reported [40,41], but were relatively high compared to many ultrafiltration polymeric substrates used for polyamide synthesis [34]. The microfiltration substrates used in this study  should therefore contribute a low mass transfer resistance to the nanofiltration thin film membranes. The PWP of the polyamide membranes PA-100 and PA-200 were 16.7 ± 0.8 and 18.4 ± 0.7 LMH bar−1, respectively. Both of the membranes exhibited similar PWP though membranes PA-200 had a slightly higher permeability. The higher permeability could be attributed to the more porous substrates, as surface porosity of substrates could also affect the water permeation in thin film composite membranes [20,21]. The PWP of the membranes was considerably high compared to most polyamide membranes on hollow fibre and tubular membrane substrates [27,42,43], though it was slightly lower than some polyamide membranes synthesized using purely PEI monomers [29]. The incorporation of a small amount of PIP could have tightened the pore structure in the membranes, as shown in the MWCO result later on. As ceramic substrates have high chemical and thermal stabilities, polyamide-ceramic composite membranes could be potentially useful for more challenging applications such as organic solvent or high temperature nanofiltration. In this study, we tested the nanofiltration performance of the resultant membranes at high temperature up to 80 °C and the results are shown in Fig. 12 (a). During the experiment, the membrane PA-100 was first tested at room temperature and the temperature of the feed solution was then increased to 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C, before it was decreased back to room temperature. The rejections of all these 4 solutes decreased with the increase in temperature, which could be caused by the enlarged effective “pore size” of polyamide at high temperature.Key: Higher permeability due to more porous substrates, better thermal and chemical stability, better mechanical properties.

       " '52\\\\Q: How will the pure water permeation change if we increase the number of LBL layers? How about shorten crosslinking time?Context: As discussed in Section 3.2, the coating of PDA/PEI increased the thickness of selective layer, thereby enhancing the hydraulic resistance through the membrane to both water and salt. In addition, the dual covalent reactions of PDA with PEI and polyelectrolytes in the LBL layer tightened the selective layer structure of the NF membrane, which induced decreased permeability. On a different note, the pure water permeability can be further improved by reducing the thickness of the substrate, increasing the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the polyelectrolyte solution, reducing the number of LBL layers, and controlling the crosslinking reaction. A systematic investigation of these parameters will be a focus in our future studies. Despite this, an obvious elevation in all salt rejections was witnessed for the PDA/PEI modified LBL membrane as compared to the LBL membrane (Fig. 6 (B) and Table A1). Particularly, the PDA/PEI coating conferred a fairly high Na2SO4 rejection to the LBL membrane; the rejection improved from 37.4% to 57.8% (Table A1). Such a higher rejection generally benefits from the size exclusion enabled by a denser selectivity layer. Nevertheless, this improvement comes at the sacrifice of pure water permeability. In the case of the commercial NF 270 membrane, the ‘loose’ and negatively charged nature was revealed as an evidence by the higher rejection against Na2SO4 and lower rejection for MgCl2 (Fig. 6(B)). As already been attested by previously study, such an observation suggested that the Donnan exclusion theory played a major role [17]. On the other hand, the salt rejection test suggested that the LBL-cPP NF membrane reached the 90% rejection for divalent  cations and about 20% rejection for monovalent cations, while maintaining the order of MgCl2 > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 > NaCl. This result was reasonable for positively charged NF membrane and corroborated the benefits of a relatively dense selectivity layer brought about by the co-deposition of PDA/PEI. Therefore, it can be concluded that similar results on MgSO4 rejection between the NF 270 and LBL-cPP membranes were due to different dominant rejection mechanisms.Key: Decrease if we increase the number of LBL layers.

       " '53\\\\Q: Why test the performance stability of LBL-cPP NF membrane?Context: The chemical stability of membrane plays a crucial role in practical applications due to the need for regular chemical cleaning. The covalent polymerization and non-covalent self-assembly synergistically induce the formation of PDA coatings, whereas the non-covalent parts are unstable under harsh conditions. It is well known that the increase of crosslinked structure in coating layer by oxidization will enhance the coating stability [49]. CuSO4/H2O2-triggered PDA/PEI codeposition process creates more covalent parts and crosslinked sites that will be further strengthened by the interactions with the LBL layer to improve coating stability. In this study, the stability of the cLBL and  LBL-cPP NF membranes was tested under different treatment conditions. All the membranes showed a stable permeability and MgCl2 rejection after continuous operation of 50 h with DI water (Fig. A4(A)). Similarly, the permeability and MgCl2 rejection of the cLBL and LBLcPP membranes experienced little change after the treatment of an acidic solution at pH 4 (Fig. A4(B)), indicating good performance stability under acidic environment. However, a remarkable increase for permeability was observed for the cLBL membrane after alkaline treatment (Fig. 7). This demonstrated that the LBL layer was irreversibly swelled due to deionization of amine groups on the PAH polymer chains under strong alkaline condition [19]. Accordingly, the MgCl2 rejection of treated the cLBL membrane dropped by 20% after three alkaline treatment cycles. In contrast, the rejection loss was negligible for the LBL-cPP membrane, which was due to the covalent crosslinking of PDA/PEI on the LBL layer.Key: Regular chemical cleaning is required during actual testing.

The rejections of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and pentaerythritol (dosed at 200 ppm each in the feed solution) were measured at 20 bar following similar procedures as the NaCl rejection measurement. Total organic carbon (TOC, Aurora 1030, OI Analytical, College Station, TX) was used to analyze the concentration of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and pentaerythritol in the feed and permeate samples. The determination of boron rejection (5 ppm, at pH 6) was similarly conducted in which an inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 8 × 00, PerkinElmer) was used to analyze  the boron concentration.38 The rejection of organic micropollutants (propylparaben, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin) was also evaluated.

Here, an innovative approach to design thin film composite (TFC) membranes with ultrahigh permeance via hydrogel assisted interfacial polymerization is reported. The hydrogel containing piperazine (PIP) monomers serving as an aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization enable homogeneous interfacial polymerization, reducing the diffusion rate of the PIP monomers, and providing mechanical strength to the thin polyamide (PA) selective layer. As a result, the synthesized advanced TFC membranes have ultrahigh high permeances of 52.8 and 62.9 L m 2 h 1 bar 1 while maintaining satisfactorily high rejections of 96.4% and 93.5% for Na2SO4, demonstrating a desalination performance superior to the PA TFC nanofiltration membranes reported so far. Moreover, the mechanism behind the exceptional high permeance is delineated by exploring theoretical hydrogel assisted interfacial polymerization via simulation. Most importantly, the fabrication process of the hydrogel-TFC membranes is simple, enabling cost-efficient and scalable manufacturing.Key: It is difficult to infer from this context. (J. Mater. Chem.

       " '57\\\\Q: How does the hydrogel-TFC membrane achieve higher permeability compared to conventional PA membranes?Context: A nanofibrous Kevlar hydrogel was applied as the substrate membrane to support the thin active PA layer during interfacial polymerization. The nano\\ue103brous hydrogel was prepared via phase inversion by immersing the Kevlar/DMSO dope solution (2 wt%, Fig. S1†) in a water bath. The obtained Kevlar hydrogel is transparent and so\\ue09d (Fig. 1a), comprising three-dimensional (3D) nano\\ue103brous networks (Fig. 1c and S2†) and is signi\\ue103cantly different from conventional polymeric membranes (Fig. S3†) in morphology and structure. Besides, the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel has a water content of 96.5 wt% which is much higher than the conventional support membrane. Such a high water uptake makes it similar to the free water phase in synthesizing a freestanding PA membrane. Therefore, the hydrogel can be applied as the aqueous phase in interfacial polymerization to enable a homogeneous polymerization. To introduce PIP monomers into the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel, PIP monomers was dissolved in the water bath which is used for the phase inversion (Fig. S6a and b†). In this case, the PIP monomers are preloaded in the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel during its formation. Then, the interfacial polymerization was initiated by pouring trimesoyl chloride (TMC)/hexane solution on the porous bottom surface (Fig. S2c†) rather than the dense top surface (Fig. S2d†) of the PIP preloaded hydrogel (Fig. 1b). A\\ue09der interfacial polymerization, crosslinked and defect-free PA selective nanolayers with a thickness down to 15.5 nm (Fig. 1d) were obtained. The hydrophilic (Fig. S7,† water contact angle: 54 ) selective PA layer is \\ue103rmly attached to, even fused to, the surface of the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel (Fig. 1e), indicating a robust interaction between the selective layer and the nano\\ue103brous hydrogel, and thus the relatively high stability of the TFC membranes. This tight integration of the PA selective layer and the Kevlar hydrogel is mainly due to the high compatibility between these two polymers resulting from the presence of the same chemical groups and their similar chemical composition (Fig. 1f). In addition, the surface of the hydrogel-TFC membrane is entirely smooth with a nanoscale roughness of nearly 8 nm (Fig. 1g). This feature differs from other reported highly permeable membranes with rough crumpled structures or Turning structures, probably endowing the resulting membranes with a lower fouling during desalination compared with these rough membranes. Most importantly, unlike conventional interfacial polymerization involving two stepwise solution immersion processes, only one simple TMC solution immersion was applied to initiate the interfacial polymerization because PIP monomers were preloaded in the hydrogel. This modified interfacial polymerization process simpli\\ue103es the overall membrane synthesis process. Therefore, large pieces of hydrogel-TFC membranes (Fig. 1h) were readily prepared in the lab. This method is also promising to be directly integrated into a commercial membrane production line for scaling up.Key: By reducing skin layer thickness. (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2020,8,3238)',\n",

The pore sizes of VNF1 and VNF2 increased with temperature enhancement (Fig. 3a). It was reported that the pore size of NF 270 increased from 0.39 nm to 0.44 nm as the temperature varied from 20 to 40 �C [16]. In this study, the pore sizes of VNF1 and VNF2 increased from 0.48 and 0.46 nm at 5 �C to 0.56 and 0.51 nm at 25 �C (Fig. 3a), respectively. The relationships between  pore size and temperature of VNF1 and VNF2 with R2 1⁄4 0.990 and 0.945 were shown in Fig. 3a, respectively. The water fluxes of VNF1 and VNF2 were measured at each pressure during temperature range of 5–25 �C (Fig. S2). The pure water permeabilities of both VNF1 and VNF2 membranes increased with temperature increasing (Fig. 3b).

The higher pure water permeability for VNF1 and VNF2 at higher temperature was mainly ascribed to the larger pore size (Fig. 3a) and lower water viscosity (Fig. S3). The pure water permeabilities of VNF1 and VNF2 were both  highly related to the temperature with R2 1⁄4 0.985 and 0.999 (Fig. 3b), respectively.

However, the effective active layer thickness of VNF2 showed no considerably difference as temperature increased from 5 to 25 �C (Fig. 3c). The surface charge densities of VNF1 and VNF2 were first determined by fitting the NaCl rejection to the water flux (Fig. S4). The VNF2 that is tight NF membrane showed higher NaCl rejections than those of VNF1 at temperatures 5–25 �C (Fig. S4).

       " '24\\\\Q: Explain why divalent ions are more effectively rejected by NF membranes than monovalent ions.Context: The  higher valence of Mg2+ (than Na+) leads to stronger solvation of Mg2+ and a correspondingly higher solvation energy barrier (specifically, the aqueous solvation energy of Na+ and Mg2+ in the bulk is 200.6 and 330.3 kcal/mol, respectively). Therefore, reducing the pore dielectric constant reduces the rejection of Mg2+ to a greater extent than reducing the rejection of Na+, thereby increasing the selective transport of Na+ over Mg2+. With a similar argument, the selective of Na+ and Mg2+ increases when the membrane becomes less negatively charged or more positively charged. The higher valence of Mg2+ leads to a stronger Donnan effect than with Na+ of a lower valence.Key: stronger Donnan exclusion due to higher charge and larger solvation energy barriers from dielectric exclusion (Journal of Membrane Science 620(2021)118809)25\\\\ Q: How does the Donnan-steric-pore model differ from the solution-diffusion model?Context:The most widely used model for mass transport is the solution-diffusion model, which assumes that water and solute species transport independently, first by dissolving or partitioning into the PA layer, followed by diffusion across the layer based on their respective concentration gradients, and finally partitioning out of the layer into the permeate. The solution-diffusion model is convenient because it enables the transport characteristics of a TFC-PA membrane to be described with two parameters: the water permeability coefficient and the solute permeability coefficient. Another widely used approach is the pore flow model, or Donnan-steric-pore model with dielectric exclusion (DSPM-DE). The DSPM-DE considers water and ion transport through tortuous cylindrical pores with charge. It can account for steric, Donnan and dielectric exclusions and hindered transport of solutes within pores129 (Fig. 5e). Although the DSPM-DE has many simplifying assumptions and controversialmechanisms, such as including dielectric exclusion, it can provide mechanistic insights about how the change in membrane properties —for instance, pore size and charge density — affects membrane separation performance, in a way not achievable with more phenomenological models. For example, pore size is not used as a parameter in the solution-diffusion, SDEM or solution-friction model.Key: DSPM-DE incorporates pore size, charge, and dielectric exclusion, whereas solution-diffusion focuses on partition and diffusion (Nature Reviews Methods Primers (2024)4:10)',\n",
       " '26\\\\Q: What is the critical condition for the formation of Turing structures?Context: Turing structures typically emerge in reactiondiffusion processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor must be larger than that of the activator, resulting in the “local activation and lateral inhibition” phenomenon (Fig. 1B) that underlies diffusion-driven instability. However, this condition is not easily satisfied in homogeneous solutions, for most chemical reactions involve small molecules with similar or inappropriately differing diffusion coefficients. In the classic Turing systems, two main approaches have been developed to selectively control the effective diffusion coefficients of reactants: (i) Introduce a macromolecule that reversibly binds the activator, like starch or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in the CIMA reaction, and (ii) use a heterogeneous finely dispersed multiphase reaction system in which the activator resides in a low-mobility phase, such as when polar BZ reagents are confined within nanosized aqueous droplets.Key: The inhibitor must have a higher diffusion coefficient than the activator.

It is based on the Schotten-Baumann reaction, in which the irreversible polymerization of two fast-reacting multifunctional monomers occurs near the interface of two immiscible phases of a heterogeneous liquid system. This technique has been used to prepare reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes for largescale and low-cost water purification applications. In a typical membrane synthesis, organic amines are dissolved in water while acyl chlorides are dissolved in an organic solvent, and a very thin insoluble polyamide (PA) membrane forms on top of a porous support. In our experiment, piperazine (PZ) is the activator, and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) is the inhibitor. The reaction is initiated when the top surface of a porous polysulfone (PSU) support containing an aqueous solution of the activator comes in contact with an organic solution of the  inhibitor. Because the acyl chloride has very little solubility in water, the polymerization occurs predominantly on the organic side of the interface. Initially, the activator reacts with the locally available inhibitor in the reaction zone, later it diffuses to penetrate more deeply into the reaction zone, and finally, a cross-linked PA membrane forms across the region of pore openings of the PSU support. This PA membrane formed by a conventional interfacial polymerization reaction is not of Turing type, for there are not appropriate differences between the diffusion coefficients of the activator and the inhibitor. During the reaction, the aqueous solution of the activator is confined within surface nanometer-sized pores of the PSU support, where physical obstruction blocks dispersed aqueous-phase movement and slows the activator transport. The diffusion coefficient of the organic molecules is around 10−5 cm2 s–1, whereas the diffusion of the dispersed aqueous phases in the organic phase can be as low as 10−6 cm2 s–1. When a certain amount of macromolecule, PVA, was added to the aqueous solution, it interacted with the activator via hydrogen bonding and increased solution viscosity, further reducing the diffusion rate of the activator. Through the synergetic effects of the physical obstruction and chemical interaction, the systems meet appropriate differences in the diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor, leading to a diffusion-driven instability and generating nanoscale spotted and striped Turing structures.Key: The inhibitor diffuses faster than the activator, leading to localized activation of polymerization and inhibition of neighboring regions.

Existing NF models predominantly include steric and Donnan mechanisms as primary mechanisms. However, these models often fail in elucidating the NF selectivity between ions of similar dimensions and the same valence. To address this gap, an innovative methodology was proposed to unravel new selective mechanisms by quantifying the nominal dielectric effect isolated from steric and Donnan exclusion through fitted pore dielectric constants by regression analysis. We demonstrated that the nominal dielectric effect encompassed unidentified selective mechanisms of significant relevance by establishing the correlation between the fitted pore dielectric constants and these hindrance factors. Our findings revealed that dehydration-induced ion−membrane interaction, rather than ion dehydration, played a pivotal role in ion partitioning within NF membranes. This interaction was closely linked to the nondeformable fraction of hydrated ions. Further delineation of the dielectric effect showed that favorable interactions between ions and membrane functional groups contributed to entropy-driven selectivity, which is a key factor in explaining ion selectivity differences between ions sharing the same size and valence.

Dielectric exclusion, attributed to the “image force” effect and the Born dielectric effect, was subsequently integrated into the steric, electric, and dielectric exclusion (SEDE) model, enhancing its accuracy. Further studies have revealed that the strength of dielectric exclusion is affected by various factors such as pore geometry, membrane material, and solution  properties, making it challenging to accurately quantify. Numerous studies have attempted to quantify dielectric exclusion, with several comprehensive reviews available in the literature. These studies demonstrate the critical role of dielectric exclusion in membrane selectivity. However, existing models often rely on semiempirical models such as the Bowen model to calculate the membrane permittivity. While mathematically convenient, this approach oversimplifies the system, which may not be compatible with the basic assumptions of NF models. An alternative method involves fitting experimental data to the NF model. The resulting value can then be used as a known parameter for subsequent model predictions, which potentially offers a more accurate representation of the complex interactions within NF membranes.Key: Can't explain the selectivity between ions of similar size and charge.

The hindrance caused by the difference in dielectric constant is known as dielectric exclusion, a fundamental mechanism long considered in NF and strongly associated with the pore size. Recent studies have shown that the use of ion cavity radius over Stokes radius could enable  more precise dielectric exclusion calculations. Consequently, the ion cavity radius is employed in this study for the quantification of dielectric exclusion.Key: It creates an energy barrier (Born solvation energy) (Environ. Sci.

Unfortunately, coupled with complex natural instability phenomena, the IP mechanism and key parameters underlying the structural evolution of nanofilms, especially in the presence of surfactants as an interface regulator, remain puzzling. Here, we interfacially assembled polymer nanofilm membranes at the free water−oil interface in the presence of differently charged surfactants and comprehensively characterized their structure and properties. Combined with computational simulations, an in situ visualization of interfacial film formation discovered the critical role of Marangoni instability induced by the surfactants via various mechanisms in structurally regulating the nanofilms. Despite their different instability-triggering mechanisms, the delicate control of the surfactants enabled the fabrication of defect-free, ultra-permselective nanofilm membranes.

However, recent evidence shows that, while the reaction is indeed slowed down considerably as seen in practically all studies described herein, this is not necessarily an intrinsic property of the film-formation process. Rather, this can be attributed to the actual barrier posed by the forming film and, perhaps as importantly, to the availability of MPD. The second point was suggested in some earlier IP models and was illustrated by Ukrainsky and Ramon, where films with thicknesses on the order of tens of microns were fabricated in a microfluidic channel, indicating that so long as MPD is supplied to the system, the IP process continues, albeit at a slower rate.Key: Not always, depending on the MPD supplied to the system.

The SLi,Mg even reached above 130 while treating the feed with a high WMg2+/Li+ of 200. The above phenomena were different from the reported results that the Mg2+ rejection was obviously decreased with the increase in WMg2+/Li+ in literature. The surprising results linked to the uniformity of charge distribution on the surface of TETA grafted PA membrane, which may be explained as follows and illustrated from the schematic diagram in Fig. 8. It was known that Mg2+ and Li+ in mixed salt system easily existed in the form of ion clusters of Mg2+/Li+/nCl⋅H2O. In high WMg2+/Li+ feed, free Mg2+ ions would markedly increase and the large-sized Mg2+/Li+/nCl⋅H2O ion clusters would reduce. For the PA membrane grafted with ARM monomers (PEI600), the big steric energy among ARM monomers would lead to big charge gaps on the membrane surface, which could not effectively electrostatically repel the free Mg2+ even in the presence of high-density positive charges. Different from grafting ARM monomers, the grafting of SCA monomers could construct a uniform positive charge layer on the surface of PA membrane to form small positively charged gaps, which effectively rejected the free Mg2+ even in high WMg2+/Li+ feed to obtain a high separation factor (SLi,Mg).Key: More uniform charge distribution (Journal of Membrane Science 677(2023)121634)',\n",

Nevertheless, Li+ in salt lake is often accompanied by Mg2+, which are nearly identical with respect to hydration radius and reactivity. Hence, effective Li+/Mg2+ separation and Li + extraction from salt lake brine with high WMg2+/Li + still remains a great challenge and is critically needed at present. In the past decade, some kinds of Li+/Mg2+ separation methods containing electrodialysis, adsorption, extraction, and nanofiltration (NF) have been explored.Key: Both ions have similar hydration radii and reactivity, making selective separation difficult.

Most existing work have often ignored the effects of charge distribution in the nanodomains of membrane surface on the separation process. Recently, the research focus of positively charged NF membranes preparation is introducing the amino-rich macromonomers (ARM) such as PEI into the separation layer or onto the surface of NF membranes because of ARM high positive charges. However, the excessive molecular size and exorbitant local positive charge density of the ARM themselves would lead to a non-uniform charge distribution in a nanoscale and a large gap among positively charged groups, which would reduce the effectiveness of charge repulsion to cations and in particular Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. Therefore, constructing a suitable charged surface layer of NF membrane would be the key to achieve Li+/Mg2+ efficient separation.Key: SCA monomers have smaller molecular sizes and lower steric energies compared to macro-monomers.

Based on the TGA results (Fig. 2a), the membranes with a higher chitosan content were generally more thermally stable than the pristine cellulose membrane M5, as demonstrated by the higher decomposition temperature of the blend membranes (~350 ℃) compared with M5 (300 ℃). The release of adsorbed water from the atmosphere was more pronounced in M5 because the first step of the weight loss curve below 150 ◦C was steeper than those for the other membranes. The improved thermal stability of the membranes fabricated using the cellulose–chitosan blends may be attributed to the entanglement of chitosan between the cellulose chains. The nanoindentation test revealed the hardening of the blend membranes after increasing the chitosan content (Fig. 2b). Improving the membrane hardness affords enhanced mechanical properties, beneficial for filtration applications.Key: Chitosan increased thermal stability by forming entanglements with cellulose chains.

       " '38\\\\Q:  How does SDS form a PA membrane with a uniform pore size distribution？Context: More importantly, the SDS-facilitated trans-interface transport of PIP also results in spatially more uniform diffusion of PIP across the interface, which is essential for the formation of a PA membrane with a uniform pore size distribution. The relationship between energy barrier and flux uniformity can be semi-quantitatively illustrated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the trans-interface transport of a group of particles with their kinetic energy following a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature. The underlying assumption is that, if the energy state of a particle exceeds a given energy barrier for trans-interface diffusion, that specific particle can successfully cross the interface. With this assumption, MC simulations of trans-interface diffusion events for 1000 particles across a 10\\u2009×\\u200910 grid suggest that a lower energy barrier results in faster and more uniform flux across the interface (Fig.\\xa03f, g). The total number of diffusion-attempts (trials) and the standard deviation of the numbers of particles passing through each grid opening decrease systematically as the energy barrier decreases (Fig.\\xa03g), which suggests that reduced energy barrier does not only accelerate interfacial transport of PIP but also renders it more uniform. Additionally, the self-assembled SDS network at the water-hexane interface may also impose steric hindrance against the diffusion of newly formed PA fragments to water, which reduces the competing hydrolysis reaction and thereby also increases the degree of crosslinking. Therefore, both the enhancement of PIP diffusion and the suppression of undesirable hydrolysis synergistically lead to a higher degree of crosslinking (Fig.\\xa02e) and a more homogeneous pore size distribution (Fig.\\xa02a).Key: Reduce energy barrier across the interface.

The shear stress generated by the movement and collapse of these bubbles can further clean the membrane surface.

       " '40\\\\Q: Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.Context: An approximate analytical model of film formation by interfacial polycondensation is presented. The analysis requires knowledge of a minimal set of certain kinetic parameters (monomer diffusivities and reaction rate constants) and reaction conditions (monomer concentrations and thickness of the unstirred layer). The process proceeds as a succession of two or three markedly different kinetic regimes. Each regime (insipient film formation, slowdown, and diffusion-limited growth) sets a different pattern of local polymer accumulation, with important implications for the structure of the emerging film. At the incipient stage, a loose polymer film begins to emerge in a fixed narrow region inside the boundary layer, followed by gradual densification of the middle part of the film. A condition for film formation is thus formulated on the basis of our analysis. The model predicts that two different scenarios are possible, which depend on the permeability of the polymer: films with a low permeability to both monomers pass through an abrupt slowdown of film growth, whereas permeable films undergo a smooth transition between the incipient film formation and diffusion-limited regimes. The model incorporates the highly important effects of the accumulation of reactive end groups and the decrease of monomer diffusion with the polymer concentration on the kinetics of the process and film characteristics. In addition, the validity of the utilized mean-field approach is analyzed, and the analysis suggests a direct correlation between the roughness and the thickness of the film.

Instead, it attempts to explicitly obtain this structure by numerical solution of diffusion and reaction equations. The model reveals that the stage of diffusion-limited growth is preceded by a very different kinetic regimesincipient film formationsthat, in some cases, may shape the final structure and morphology of the film. The important points may be summarized as follows:18,19 (1) The model predicts rapid formation of a film of finite thickness, followed by an abrupt slowdown of the interfacial polymerization process. (2) The thickness of the incipient film decreases slowly with a decrease in concentration of either of the monomers. (3) Both the reactivity of the monomer and thickness of the boundary diffusion layer (i.e., hydrodynamic conditions) affect the film thickness. (4) The polymer film possesses a dense core (the actual barrier) hidden inside a looser polymer structure. (5) The dense core separates the film into two distinct regions, in each of which one type of monomer and end group is in large excess over the other. The latter two conclusions are in remarkable agreement with direct microscopic observation of actual polyamide films constituting reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membranes (see Figure 1).Key: Monomer diffusivities and reaction rate constants (Langmuir 2005,21,1884-1894)',\n",

Using the abovegiven analysis, we can quantify this statement. It is clear that a film can be formed only if the thickness of the incipient reaction zone (δ0) does not exceed the thickness of the unstirred boundary layer (L). If this condition is not fulfilled, a significant portion of the polymer will form outside the unstirred layer and will travel away from the interface by convection before its molecular weight significantly increases. Ultimately, the polymer will be evenly distributed in the bulk solution, and homogeneous bulk polymerization will thus occur.Key: Reaction rate constant exceeding a threshold value.

       " \"43\\\\Q: What is the proposed mechanism for achieving ultrathin nanofilms with Janus substrates?Context: The reaction kinetics under varying total diamine monomer amounts were investigated by in situ monitoring of monomer  consumption to reveal the underlying regulating mechanisms by the hydrophilic layer thickness (Fig. 3 and Figs. S8 and S9). The absorbance of a charge–transfer complex formed by piperazine and alizarin red at 520 nm linearly increases with the piperazine concentration [15]. Thus, the piperazine consumption can be determined by the absorbance change during interfacial polymerization. A real-time mode was used to monitor the concentration evolution near the reaction interface (Fig. 3A and B). To simulate the role of the hydrophilic layer, the solution volume rather than the diamine concentration was changed to adjust the total monomer amount, and the reaction interface was fixed by applying a spacer for different solution volumes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the absorbance near the interface decreases more sharply with a lower piperazine amount, indicating that the piperazine concentration near the interface decreased more quickly. The reduced concentration may decrease  the diffusion rate of piperazine across the interface to the reaction zone according to Fick's law, which can slow down the formation of polyamide nanofilms. Furthermore, by calculating the monomer consumption, lower piperazine participated in the reaction with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time. This result proves that the aqueous solution volume or total monomer amount control provides an effective way to adjust the reaction kinetics, polymerization window, and polyamide growth. On the other hand, the reaction kinetics can also be reflected by the consumption rate of trimesoyl chloride, which can be obtained by in situ monitoring its concentration change according to the positive linear relationship between the concentration and the absorbance peak of the organic solution at 290 nm (Figs. S8 and S9). Lower trimesoyl chloride was consumed with decreased total amount of piperazine under the same reaction time, indicating that the participation of trimesoyl chloride in the reaction can also be controlled. These results mean that the reaction between the two monomers can be confined remarkably by limiting the total amount of the diamine monomer solution, which accounts for the reduced thickness of polyamide nanofilms (Fig. 2). According to the monitoring of the reaction kinetics of interfacial polymerization, the regulation mechanism is proposed (Fig. 3D). At the initial stage of the reaction, a high local piperazine concentration can promote the reaction between piperazine and trimesoyl chloride to form an integral nanofilm. Subsequently, as the piperazine is consumed, the total piperazine amount decreases rapidly and the reaction is terminated at a relatively earlier stage of interfacial polymerization, avoiding the further growth of the nanofilm. This mechanism gives us a guideline to control the violent interfacial polymerization and regulate the structure and property of polyamide nanofilms.Key: The hydrophilic layer maintain a high concentration at the reaction interface, leading to form an integral nanofilm.

       " '44\\\\Q: What challenges does the conventional hydrophilic substrate pose in interfacial polymerization?Context: In summary, we have developed a novel strategy to synthesize ultrathin polyamide nanofilms by virtue of Janus substrates as a confined interfacial polymerization platform to govern the reaction process. The aqueous solution of amine monomer  can be confined within the adjustable hydrophilic layer of the Janus substrate, by which the total monomer amount can be regulated for controlling the interfacial polymerization. By tuning the piperazine amount reserved within the Janus substrate at a low level, sub–5-nm polyamide nanofilms have been synthesized at a relatively high local piperazine concentration, which endows the polyamide nanofilms with an integral structure and small pore size. The water permeance has greatly elevated by more than six times when the nanofilm thickness decreases from 88.4 to 3.8 nm while keeping a competitive Na2SO4 rejection of ~96%. Such a composite membrane performs superior nanofiltration performance to most of the recently reported ones. This strategy offers a novel and practical “interfacial reactor” to regulate the interfacial polymerization process as well as the nanofilm structure by engineering the porous substrates.Key: Conventional substrates either produce thick, low-permeance films at high monomer concentrations or defective films at low concentrations, limiting the balance between permeance and selectivity.

       " '45\\\\Q: What factors affect the rejection performance of loose nanofiltration membranes?Context: The zeta potential and inorganic salts (MgCl2, NaCl, MgSO4 and Na2SO4) rejection of the novel loose NF membranes were exhibited in Fig. 10. The rejections of membranes for different salts followed the order: MgCl2 > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 > NaCl. This can be explained in terms of sieving and dielectric exclusion effects. The hydrated ionic radii of salts followed the order: magnesium (0.43 nm) > sulphate (0.38 nm) > sodium (0.36 nm) > chloride(0.33 nm). Therefore, the rejection of membrane was biggest for MgCl2 while it was smallest for NaCl at fixed gallic acid concentrations and PEI concentration in coating solution. Moreover, the selective layer of prepared membrane became denser with increasing gallic acid concentrations at fixed PEI concentration in coating solution, therefore the rejections of the loose NF membranes for all salt were repectively increased due to the steric effect. Meanwhile, as observed from Fig. 10, the obvious variation of the zeta potential (from 25.06 mV to 16.64 mV) had not been observed and the surface charge of the membrane was still dominated by the charge of PEI layer. Therefore, the higher cation density of modified PEI layer may result in more electrostatic repulsion for bivalent co-ion (Mg2+) than monovalent ion (Na+) at differnet gallic acid concentrations.Key: both the sieving effect and Donnan effect.

       " '46\\\\Q: What role does tannic acid (TA) play in the TA@BM-Spray membrane?Context: The modifier TA, a cost-effective polyphenol derived from plants, contains catechol and galloyl groups that exhibit excellent coating ability. It can adhere to various substrate surfaces via covalent and/or noncovalent bonding, enabling the functionalization of liposomes with a hydrophilic surface and yolk-shell structure. Evidently, the spray-assisted integration of TA-encapsulated liposomes ensures uniform predeposition upon the substrate surface, guaranteeing a PA layer with an analogously crumpled and rough structural profile as observed in liposome-incorporated membranes. The introduction of TA mitigates potential non-selective defects through chemical interactions with reactive monomers and liposomes (e. g., Schiff base reaction, Michael addition, hydrogen bonding and acylation, etc.), as well as the strong adsorption ability onto the PSf substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. As a compatibility promoter, TA plays a critical role in establishing a robust interfacial bridge between the liposomes and PA active layer at the molecular level. Simultaneously, as a hydrophilic enhancer, TA introduces multiple hydrophilic sites enveloping the liposomes, making them more water-contactable and contributing to the formation of a highly hydrophilic membrane surface. In conjunction with the TA@liposomes-assisted protuberances and nanovoids, which enhance membrane surface roughness and effective surface area, along with improvement in surface hydrophilicity and cross-linking degree, these structural and physicochemical features of the TA@BM-Spray membrane collectively achieve enhanced water permeance and water-salt selectivity.Key: Chemical interactions with reactive monomers and substrates reduce potential non-selective defects.

       " '47\\\\Q: How do nanovesicles influence the morphology of the PA layer? And explain the role of nanovesicles in enhancing water permeance.Context: To comprehensively rationalize the observed separation performances, we initially reassess the design of the bioinspired SWRO membranes. Characterization results demonstrate that the nanovesicleintegrated PA selective layer differs significantly from its nanovesiclefree counterpart. Traditionally, amine monomers undergo diffusion across the aqueous phase to react with the organic monomers at the immiscible interface, forming a dense selective layer with minimal nanovoids and restricted effective surface area. This results in relatively low water permeance and moderate salt rejection. Nevertheless, the incorporation of E. coli-based liposomes via conventional blending or spray-assisted predeposition increases the diffusion rate and penetration depth of amine monomers into the organic phase. This effect is mainly owing to the creation of a broader “miscible region” at the reaction interface, driven by lower interfacial tension, which results in a PA morphology with greater protuberance and a rougher structure (Fig. 7a). In the BM-Conv and BM-spray membranes, this crumpled structure, characterized by a larger surface area and enhanced wettability, along with the lower hydrodynamic resistance from increased rear surface porosity and larger nanovoids size beneath the crumpled PA active layer, collectively facilitates the water transport of the liposomesincorporated membranes. However, the intensified polymerization process induced by the presence of liposomes due to the increased monomer supply and the local temperature rise can destabilize incipient PA oligomers, leading to a loosely cross-linked PA matrix. This contributes to higher water permeance but compromises water-salt selectivity. More importantly, the formation of additional channels and non-selective defects between the unreactive liposomes and the PA layer, as well as substrate, due to poor interfacial compatibility, further accounts for the slight decline in salt rejection observed in membranes embedded with unmodified liposomes. Despite this, the bioinspired membranes fabricated using conventional blending and spray-assisted strategies demonstrated comparable separation performance. Notably, the amount of liposomes required for the spray-assisted membrane was only 3.8 % of that needed for the blending strategy, indicating that the spraying approach allows precise control of liposome deposition and minimizes wastage of valuable additives, ensuring high utilization efficiency.Key: They reduce interfacial tension, promoting amine monomer diffusion and forming a rougher structure.

       " '48\\\\Q: What factors contributed to the high rejection of divalent salts compared to monovalent salts?Context: The membranes were also tested for salt rejection (Fig. 10) and they showed good rejection for divalent ions with rejection > 90%. For membrane PA-100, the rejections of CaCl2, MgCl2 and MgSO4 were 94.3, 95.2 and 91.6%, respectively. However, the rejections of Na2SO4 and NaCl were only 65.3 and 36.4, respectively. The good rejection of divalent ion salts could be explained by the effect of steric hindrance as the hydrated radiuses of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are larger than Na+. The same effect can also explain the higher rejection of Na2SO4 over NaCl as ion SO4  2− has a larger hydrated radius. When tested using salt solution with a higher concentration 2000 ppm, the membrane still showed good rejection of MgCl2 and MgSO4, with a rejection rate of 94.1 and 91.5%, respectively. However, the consistently relatively lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 at both feed concentrations could not be fully explained using the steric hindrance effect. To further understand the salt rejection results, the surface charge of the membranes were measured and the zeta potential results are presented in Fig. 11. The zeta potential of the tubular membrane was measured using the streaming potential method at pH ranging from 3 to 9.5. The ceramic substrate had an isoelectric point at about pH 5, exhibiting anionic surface charge under pH > 5. However, the isoelectric points of both of the membrane PA-100 and PA-200 shifted significantly towards a higher pH but were not determined during the measurement due to the limited pH range of the equipment. Isoelectric points at a relatively high pH were observed previously when mixed PEI and PIP  was used as the polyamide monomers [45]. The PEI-based polyamide membranes exhibited positively charged surface for a large pH range including at pH of the fed solution in this study (∼pH 6.5). The positively charged surface was mainly attributed to the protonation of unreacted amine groups in the membranes. Therefore, the higher rejection of divalent ions could also be contributed by the Donnan effect [46]. However, the positive field on the membrane surface could be greatly affected by divalent counter-ion SO4  2−. The lower MgSO4 rejection compared to MgCl2 could be due to the weakened Donnan effect. Nevertheless, the rejection of MgSO4 was still > 90%, higher than many PEI-based polyamide membranes with a positively charged surface, which could be due to the tighter polyamide network as the result of the addition of PIP in this study.Key: Divalent ions have larger hydrated radii (steric hindrance) and stronger electrostatic interactions with the positively charged membrane surface.

The PES substrate presented a smooth and porous surface morphology, while a rough and compact surface with irregular topography was observed for the cLBL membrane (Fig. 4(B)). This characterization once again confirms a full coverage of polyelectrolyte depositions on the substrate. This result was vindicated by AFM images that presented increased roughness (Ra) from 2.22 ± 0.78 nm for the PES substrate to 12.62 ± 0.91 nm for the cLBL membrane (Fig. A3). After the introduction of a crosslinked PDA/PEI layer, a rougher surface with grainy and convex nanostructures was observed for the LBL-cPP membrane (Fig. 4 (C) and Fig. A3(D)). This indicated fewer visible PDA aggregates were deposited on the LBL layer. This phenomenon could be attributed to the diminishing of non-covalent interactions in the PDA aggregates caused by nucleophilic amine groups of the PEI molecules [27]. Meanwhile, the aggregation of PDA was also disrupted by the size control-inhibition mechanism of polyelectrolytes as discussed above. Eventually, the PDA/PEI deposition layer tailored the NF membrane with a homogeneous surface. By referencing to the FESEM images, the thickness of the PES substrate and cLBL membrane were compared. After PDA/PEI deposition, the average thickness of the crosslinked PDA/PEI coated LBL layer was increased to 116.1 ± 5.2 nm (Fig. 4 (F)), compared with the single crosslinked LBL layer (thickness of 48.8 ± 5.0 nm in Fig. 4 (E)). The corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4 (G-I)) also confirmed the thickness variations of the coated layers, which revealed that the PDA/PEI deposition layer was uniformly and compactly anchored on the LBL surface. More importantly, the PDA particles could be observed in the deposition layer (Fig. 4 (I)), further demonstrating effective inhibition of PDA aggregation.Key: To suppress PDA aggregation and improve uniformity.

The EEM fluorescence spectra provide better understanding of the organic compositions in the permeate for each process as well as its surface foulants. As depicted in Fig. 10 (A), the EEM plots for feed solution were classified into four sections - I (humic-like substances; Ex > 280 nm, Em > 380 nm), II (protein-like substances; Ex = 250–280 nm, Em < 380 nm), III (fulvic acid-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em > 380 nm), and IV (tyrosine-like substances; Ex = 220–250 nm, Em = 330–380 nm) [51]. A distinct peak for tyrosine-like substances (IV) could be observed in feed solution, which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids. After the filtrations, the peak intensities of tyrosine-like substances (IV) decreased by 84.2%, 89.3% and 93.9% for the permeates of the NF 270, cLBL and LBL-cPP membranes, respectively, compared to the feed solution, indicating better removal efficiency for tyrosine-like substances. In particular, the LBL-cPP membrane presented significant removal efficiency (decreased by 96.1%) for protein-like substances (II) from the feed solution, which was confirmed by its almost disappearing peak intensity (Fig. 10 (A)). Hence, the LBL-cPP membrane has a higher capacity to provide better permeate quality. It should be noted a small amount of fulvic acid-like substances (III) were identified in the permeate of all NF membranes. This is most likely due to their smaller molecular weights than the MWCOs of the NF membranes. Meanwhile, simpler organic compositions were illustrated by the foulant on the surface of the LBL-cPP membrane, which were composed of very small amounts of protein-like substances (II) and part of tyrosine-like substances (IV) that appeared far less than the amount on NF270 and cLBL (Fig. A5). These results were consistent with the flux profile of the LBLcPP membrane. Owing to the competitive hydrophilicity of the LBL-cPP membrane, most of the humic-like substances (I) and protein-like substances (II) did not adsorb onto the membrane surface.Key: LBL-cPP effectively removes low molecular weight organics and divalent ions, reducing RO fouling by minimizing organic-inorganic interactions and biofilm formation.

       " '51\\\\Q: Please generate a title for this article based on the abstract.Context: Thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes have been widely studied over the past decade for their desalination applications. For some cases, the incorporation of nonporous hydrophilic nanofillers has been reported to greatly enhance membrane separation performance, yet the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The current study systematically investigates TFN membranes incorporated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). For the first time, we reveal the formation of nanochannels of approximately 2.5 nm in size around the AgNPs, which can be attributed to the hydrolysis of trimesoyl chloride monomers and thus the termination of interfacial polymerization by the water layer around each hydrophilic nanoparticle. These nanochannels nearly tripled the membrane water permeability for the optimal membrane. In addition, this membrane showed increased rejection against NaCl, boron, and a set of small-molecular organic compounds (e.g., propylparaben, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin), thanks to its combined effects of improved size exclusion, enhanced Donnan exclusion, and suppressed hydrophobic interaction. Our work provides fundamental insights into the formation and transport mechanisms involved in solid-filler incorporated TFN membranes. Future studies should take advantage of this spontaneous nanochannel formation in the design of TFN to overcome the classical membrane permeability−selectivity trade-off.Key: Hydrophilic Silver Nanoparticles Induce Selective Nanochannels in Thin Film Nanocomposite Polyamide Membranes (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2019,53,5301−5308)',\n",
       " '52\\\\Q: How does the rejection rate of the TFN membrane for positively charged hydrophilic compounds change compared to the membrane without AgNP addition?Key: Decrease. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2019,53,5301−5308)53\\\\Q：What is the advantage of the DSPM-DE model over existing models for nanofiltration?Context: DSPE-DE model provides information regarding the magnitudes of the different modes of solute exclusion occurring at the membrane-solution interfaces, namely steric exclusion (size-based exclusion at the pore opening), Donnan effect (repulsion or attraction effect due to membrane potential) and dielectric exclusion (resistance to the solute entering the membrane pores due to an energy barrier associated with shedding of the solute hydration shell in order to enter the pore).Key: DSPM-DE is a comprehensive model for nanofiltration. (Desalination 420(2017)241–257)54\\\\Q：How does the pore size of the membrane change with increasing temperature?Context: Usually, water flux through nanofiltration membranes increases with increase in temperature.Key: The pore size of the membrane increases with the increase of temperature. (Desalination 420 (2017) 241–257)55\\\\Q：How does the pore size of the membrane change with increasing temperature?Context: Usually, uncharged solute rejection reduces with increase in temperature.Key: The pore size of the membrane increases with the increase of temperature. (Desalination 420 (2017) 241–257)56\\\\Q：How does the pore size of the membrane change with increasing temperature based on the following phenomenon?Context: The variation of charged solute rejection with temperature depends on the ion and the membrane used.Key: Not clear. (Desalination 420 (2017) 241–257)57\\\\Q：Why does uncharged molecular rejection decrease with increasing temperature?Context: From the study of Manttari et al. on the nanofiltration of glucose and pulp mill effluent over a temperature range of 25 °C to 65 °C using several different membranes, the authors found that the rejection of uncharged solutes decreased by ~20% from 20 °C to 55 °C and the overall rejection of the ionic species remained almost unchanged (at ~90%) over the same range of temperature.Key: The pore size of the membrane increases with the increase of temperature. (Desalination 119(1998)295–302)58\\\\Q：Please infer the reason why the divalent ion retention rate does not change much with increasing temperature.Context: Schaep et al. experimentally studied the nanofiltration of ground water using the UTC-20 NF membrane over a temperature range of 10 °C to 30 °C and found that water flux at 30 °C is 1.5 times that at 10 °C. In their study, the rejection of mono-valent ions (sodium, chloride and potassium) decreased significantly over the given range of temperature, while the rejection of divalent ions (calcium, magnesium and sulfate) was barely affected by temperature, showing only a slight increase with increase in temperature. Nilsson et al. mention that there is no significant change in the isoelectric point of the Alfa Laval NFT-50 membrane with variation of temperature, hence indicating that the membrane charge properties are not greatly affected by temperature.Key: Because the divalent ions are mainly affected by Donnan exclusion effect, but the membrane charge properties are not greatly affected by temperature. (J. Membr. Sci. 312 (2008) 97–106)59\\\\Q：What mechanisms affect ion separation?Context: The DSPM considered only the steric and Donnan exclusion mechanisms. This model quickly became popular and was successful in modeling nanofiltration of a wide variety of solutions, even those consisting of multivalent co-ions (ions with the same charge as the membrane). However, its major drawback was in its failure to model experiments with multivalent counter-ions. This failure was attributed to the deficiency of the exclusion mechanisms considered. The DSPM-DE model includes an additional exclusion mechanism, known as dielectric exclusion which allowed researchers to overcome the difficulties in modeling multivalent counter-ions.Key: Steric hinderance, Donnan exclusion and electric exclusion. (J. Membr. Sci. 321 (2) (2008) 172–182.)60\\\\Q：Which is more important for dielectric repulsion, the image force or the Born effect?Context: Bandini et al. mention two mechanisms for dielectric exclusion by nanofiltration membranes: image forces and the Born effect. The small pores in nanofiltration membranes cause the intra-pore dielectric constant of the solvent to be almost equal to that of the membrane material itself. Furthermore, the image charges are screened by electric double layers in electrolyte solutions.Key: Born effect. (J. Membr. Sci. 321 (2) (2008) 172–182.)']"

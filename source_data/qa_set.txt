Achieving such a precise separation using membranes requires Angstrom scale pores with a high level of pore size uniformity. Herein, we demonstrate that precise solute-solute separation can be achieved using polyamide membranes formed via surfactant-assembly regulated interfacial polymerization (SARIP). The dynamic, self-assembled network of surfactants facilitates faster and more homogeneous diffusion of amine monomers across the water/hexane interface during interfacial polymerization, thereby forming a polyamide active layer with more uniform sub-nanometre pores compared to those formed via conventional interfacial polymerization. The polyamide membrane formed by SARIP exhibits highly size-dependent sieving of solutes, yielding a step-wise transition from low rejection to near-perfect rejection over a solute size range smaller than half Angstrom. SARIP represents an approach for the scalable fabrication of ultra-selective membranes with uniform nanopores for precise separation of ions and small solutes.\n", "45\\Q: Which monomers are commonly used to synthesize desalination-oriented polyamide membranes via interfacial polymerization? - -A:Trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP).

In addition, the TFC-Ag membranes showed increased presence of AgNPs at higher concentration of the AgNO3, which is consistent with the ICP analysis (Figure S1). At relatively low AgNP loading, no severe aggregation of AgNPs occurred (e.g., see the high resolution TEM for TFC-Ag20 in Figure S7a). Nevertheless, aggregation of AgNPs became obvious for TFC-Ag100 (see its TEM cross-section in Figure 2) due to the high AgNO3 used to generate the AgNPs. Interestingly, we observed the presence of a light-colored ring around each AgNP in the magnified TEM cross-sections of the TFC-Ag membranes (insets of Figure 2, right panel; also see Figure S7b). Such rings were not found in the control TFC membrane. In TEM micrographs, the light colored region  corresponds to lower mass density.43 Therefore, we attribute the rings in the TFC-Ag membranes to the presence of nanochannels around the AgNPs. The TEM characterization directly supports our hypothesis: the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticles induces the formation of nanochannels. In the current study, the hydrophilic AgNPs (Figure S1) could attract water molecules around them, which serve to hydrolyze TMC and terminate the interfacial polymerization in their vicinity (Figure 1a). Further analysis suggests that the size of these nanochannels was approximately 2.5 nm and was nearly independent of the silver loading (Figure S3).\n", "1\\Q:在离子脱除率测试中，对于家用纳滤膜而言，测试液浓度为多少mg/L？-A:100.

(C) (npj Clean Water (2024)7:25)\n", "Context: In general, the enhancement factor of the TFC-Ag20 membrane systematically decreased with the increased molecular weight. This is reasonable; when the size of the solute is larger than the pores of both membranes, the selectivity enhancement factor would theoretically approach to unity (i.e., no enhancement) since both membranes would completely reject the solute. Interestingly, the salt (NaCl) and the hydrophobic compound (propylparaben) showed greater enhancement in selectivity compared to the trend line that incorporated the effect of size exclusion. This result suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms. The charged NaCl benefits from the additional Donnan exclusion effect with the presence of the negatively charged AgNPs (Table S1). The suppressed hydrophobic interaction for the propylparaben (thanks to the hydrophilic nature of AgNPs), in addition to its enhanced size exclusion effect, explains the greatly improved selectivity of the TFCAg20 membrane against this hydrophobic compound.\n"]
